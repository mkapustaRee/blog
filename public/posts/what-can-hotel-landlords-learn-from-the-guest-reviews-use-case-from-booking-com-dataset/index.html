<div id="background-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Background Information</h2>
<p>In this article, I will analyze <strong>textual data from hotel reviews</strong>. This analysis will focus on real estate investors or landlords since guest reviews offer insight into hotel performace. Social media and smartphone revolution enabled reviews, comments and travel blogs to be written by guests. Nowadays, every single guest is kindly asked to write a review of his stay. These reviews are stored on websites. Several websites (tripadvisors.com, booking.com) reached a critical size and contain extensive data on the first-hand guests experiences. This textual data is valuable but hard to extract. Humans will struggle to read thousands of reviews and then write a non-biased analysis. Computers can.</p>
<p>This article is broken into three chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter #1 What can we learn from guest score distribution?<br />
</li>
<li>Chapter #2 Can we spot what’s wrong with a group of hotels using one chart?</li>
<li>Chapter #3 Recommendation for property owner: Strand Palace Hotel reviews analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What can we learn from guest score distribution?</h2>
<p>The data used in this analysis is available on the website <strong>www.kaggle.com</strong>. The dataset of interest is from the www.booking.com and contains nearly 500.000 reviews from approx. 1500 hotels (Paris, Barcelona, Vienna, London and Milan).</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at all hotels on displayed on a map.</p>

<p>Glancing over the map we can state that the dataset contains hotel located mostly in the city center. Next, let’s look at the distribution of hotel score by business, and leisure guests. Bear in mind, that 10 points are the highest score and one is the lowest score the hotel guest can provide.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/distribution%20of%20scores%20by%20trip%20rationale-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The chart shows business guests are more critical with an average score of 8.19. Leisure guests scored their trip on average - 8.53. Additionally, the business guest review distribution is a more slightly “wider”. This means inconsistent hotel experience might exist. As a hotel operator, you always prefer to achieve consistent (high) results - thus narrow distribution is desired.</p>
<p>Now, lets find out if the distributions is different across cities?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/distribution%20of%20scores%20by%20trip%20rationale%20and%20city-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>From the chart above we can see that the business guest review score varies between 7.9 (Milan) and 8.35 (Vienna). Additionally, the leisure guests consistently score their hotel stay higher than business travelers. Interesting!</p>
<p>Now, since we have the reviewer nationality data, is there a country-specific pattern?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/distribution%20by%20reviewer%20group-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>As expected, each group is acting slightly different. The MENA region business travelers are more critical (average score is just 7.8 points), then guests from the USA or APAC region.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the top hotels receiving the highest score from a business guest in Europe.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/top_leisure_business_hotels-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Surprisingly, among the top ten hotels, Barcelona was represented four out of ten times. The Serras Hotel received the best average score. Only two London hotels (Soho Hotel and Rosewood) made in into the top list. Interestingly, three hotels in Vienna made it into the top ten.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the hotel with the highest business guest score by country of origin. As we learned, country groups behave differently. This could also mean they prefer different Hotels to stay. Let’s look only at the hotels in the London market. <img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/top_leisure_business_hotels%20by%20traveler-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>Interestingly, the MENA travelers score Park Plaza, Wembley Holiday Inn and Adria Hotels with the highest score.</p>

<p>Now, let’s move away from guest review score data, and focus on the actual textual information. The words used when writing the review are a great source of unstructured data. Open-source programming languages (like R) allow usage of specialized tools (packages/library) to work with text (with ease). One of the suitable tools for the job is the <strong>tidytext</strong> package developed by Julia Silge, David Robinson (among other authors).</p>
<p>The process of tidying the unstructured text data includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>selecting ten most frequently reviewed hotels and focusing on the negative reviews</li>
<li>cutting the reviews into individual words</li>
<li>removing the stopwords</li>
<li>apply inverse document frequency to assign unique words to a particular hotel</li>
</ul>
<p>This process will create a table containing the words associated the most with specific hotels within the peer group.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/explore%20td-idf-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The chart above shows that in guests of Britannia International Hotel Canary Wharf frequently used words like <strong>“dlr”</strong> or <strong>“train”</strong> in the review. After a quick google search, I understand that the hotel area is next to the train tracks. This location is a critical issue. <strong>In real estate world: you can fix the building, but not the location.</strong> Similar to Britannica the Copthorne hotel location is adjacent to the train tracks. Grand Royale in Hyde Park guests had a problem with loud floorboards, basement, boilers, and blinds. Such faults <strong>can be managed</strong> by a decent <strong>refurbishment</strong>.</p>

<h2>Recommendation for property owner: Strand Palace Hotel reviews analysis.</h2>
<p>After the group review, I will focus on one particular hotel Strand Palace Hotel in London. I will try to extract the maximum pieces of information from the guest reviews.</p>
<p>Firstly, how is the average score changing over time? Are the scores consistent?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/reviews%20over%20time-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>From the chart above we can see the reviewer score over time split between business and leisure guests. Both are showing up the drop in the score in summer 2017. Business guests are overall more critical, but the fall in the score is concerning.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the reviews themselves.</p>

staff","Dirty there where hairs and trash on the floor The heater didn t work The room was next to a shared bathroom and you could hear literally everything The bathroom was worse than a public bathroom The hole hostel had bad smell We had to live right away because it was horrible and they charged us the two night anyway The photos are a lie","Booking in staff told us it was an excellent room window view of a dirty courtyard looking into other hotel rooms and the room right opposite 3 lifts is not an excellent room a slow bar tender taking forever to serve 1 small drink would rather

stayed in london depressing experience","I would never stay here again We were not able to check in for several hours as the computers were down The lobby was cold and full of very unhappy guests It was January and the heating in the room did not work but the staff did not inform us of this upon check in We requested a room change but were told we could not because of the special booking price A tiny portable heater was provided which made no difference The duvets were paper thin more for summer than winter No chance we would ever be confortable in the cold dreary room We requested to cancel our booking so we could find a more suitable hotel The hotel said we must call Booking com They said only the hotel could refund our money I offered a compromise and pay for one night of a two night booking The manager refused So we left the hotel with our bags on a cold rainy day and found a decent place to stay 430 wasted They can keep my money I will keep my dignity","No air conditioning mold phone was left in the room and missing when we returned never to be found Don t know why this hotel had such high reviews on booking com","The breakfast wasn t great But what really Horrified us was the concierge telling us we had 48 hours to pay the congestion charge but we now have a fine as the charge has to be paid within 24 hours so the poor advice from the hotel staff cost us 135 extremely disappointed","EVERYTHING except the location HOW does booking com appraise this hotel with 4 starts You are deceiving your costumers This hotel deserve 2 starts at max If you would like to try living in a cave then welcome to this hotel The rooms are extremely small the price is very high very poor treatment from the staff Very noisy and dirty HONESTLY this was the only bad part of my visit to

phone Heard nothing","Price of executive rooms not worth money Just a standard room Views onto a brick wall Very noisy lifts not adequate with so many guest and cases Poor","The Executive Room was poor and definitely not value for money Our room was inward facing basically it s outlook was other rooms in the square Not what you d expect for the nightly price of 240 The bed was small and there was no choice of pillows they were all hard and did not mould to accommodate your head The bathroom was fairly spacious but looked tired and there was no wow factor to it The staff were pleasant but it felt as if this was more out of contractual obligation rather than any real desire to please Overall we were very disappointed and wouldn t recommend this hotel","Everything","room size of bed","Paid for an executive double room and it was so small with tinted window view so very dark and not comfortable at all","The smell of room the size of the room the price","Small And old room Not

connect myself an electric radiator see photo Bathroom small if you are overweight you will hardly reach the toilet and cold you can only heat it running hot water from the shower No light or mirror for shaving Ugly carpet everywhere except bathroom","In fairness the amount paid for the room type was no better than a travel lodge or premier inn in fact I would go as far to say the 2 mentioned have better bathroom facilities and sized bedroom","Not a friendly welcoming at check in Got a room with very thin walls and a drunk arguing and partying couple next door that was very noisy between midnight and 7 o clock in the morning This ruined my sleep completely Breakfasts the next morning was also a disappointment when it comes to the quality of what was served Overall one of the worst hotel experiences I ve ever had","Every time the toilet flushed there was a very loud noise that lasted for 5 mins and was very disturbing especially in the middle of the night When I told reception in the morning there was no interest and not even an apology Very unhelpful","Poor hotel for the price Rooms very basic Uncomfortable beds Queuing for breakfast Sticky tables Cold buffet breakfast","No air condition in the hotel rooms except in Exec rooms according to hotel staff No information provided about that in advance or on the web site","The 4 star rating is not deserved by this hotel The staff doesn t pay attention to the guests or does it as a great favor rather than their jobs Your arrival at the hotel starts with you carrying your suitcases up the welcome stairs while the concierges and other staff attending the valet parking and desks My room had a window into the internal ventilation non garden with fans producing constant noise Luckily I was staying in this hotel in September as I don t think it is survivable in Summer due to lack of A C Furniture and bathroom are weared off to the level of a 2 star motel Oh and remember to take flip flops when you are going to the shower Chances are the floor will have a nice big puddle when you finish","For a 4 star hotel in such a great location they should be ashamed it could be something special and probably was at one time Looked dirty or perhaps tired and dated would be better words think 70 s Most of the staff could not care less but some were very nice Food not good at all had better meals at the Premier Inn Could not get the heating to work rang for assistance and neither could the maintenance guy On check in we were charged extra an extra 20 to take the room earlier then allocated a tiny room although we had paid extra for a larger executive double room When I spoke to reception I was told that we had been allocated the correct room Eventually but only after being very insistant they admitted they had made a mistake with our room and give me the keys to the executive double we had ordered The new room was unmistakable because of the big brass plaque on the door which said incredibly Executive Double What a scam if we had said nothing about the room they could have resold our room as an upgrade or similar Wont be booking again to stay at the Stand Palace shame because it could be a great hotel","No real welcome or warmth from the staff who all seemed harrassed and overworked Discovering a dirty quilt cover at bedtime was unforgiveable Had to wait for housekeeping to come and change it The bar service was very poor after being ignored for almost 15 minutes had to ask to be served Breakfast service was worse Even in executive dining they use some kind of wipe clean cloth almost like plastic which was so wet when we sat down that we had to use the paper napkins to dry it The breakfast service was extremly slow and the quality was not good Dried up bacon undercooked egg cold beans And tea that was so weak it struggled to crawl out of the pot unaided Not worth the money","Overcharged by 920 and still waiting for the refund told it will take a week Yet

windows open due to the heat Had to use ear plugs to sleep The carpet was tore down The closet was a joke Hugely overpriced","Each year my wife and I have an annual trip to London for a show and site seeing In the past we have stopped at the Trafalgar Sq Thistle and Ramada Edwardian This year we decided to stay at the Strand Palace which was a big mistake Even though we paid significantly more

so called guest relations manager was a complete disgrace keeping us waiting for 20 minutes and then taking 3 internal phone calls whilst attending to us Everyone there are hundreds of hotels on Booking com in London avoid this one","The room was too small and far from being well designed The corridors were full of dirty trays that remained there after more than 3 hours The lobby was packed with people looking as if they were camping there The bars looked and were served as cheap bus station shops You feel like being in an improvised post emergency accommodation at some times but at the price of a four star hotel","If you get a room on the 2nd floor located over Strand street the traffic noise is so loud it is impossible to sleep during the night The windows of this 4 star hotel are absolutely not sound proof","The staff could be friendlier and more helpful Especially the front desk staff they were the worst and the cleaning people seemed nice enough but nobody spoke English so

enough information to help you I booked it as a 4 but would only class it as a 3 was quite disappointed Would not recommend it as a 4 to friends","The place is overpriced for the type of room you get If you are single you are better off in a hostel You will get a better accommodation there The rooms have no air conditioning and are closed off from air making it very hot in the rooms and uncomfortable The beds are saggy and are worse than some hostels Not what I would expect from a so called 3 or 4 star hotel I would avoid this place","Very uncomfortable and stiflingly hot I contemplated sleeping in the lobby as it seemed to be the only place that had air conditioning Not worth a fraction of the price it commands","The room was absolutely airless to the point of stifling although I had an extre night booked I decided to leave one night early as I couldn t stand another night of roasting in hell I had a single room one night facing a wall so changed to a double not much bigger still facing a wall and like an oven Also they were very unbending about changing one night s accommodation for me to another although in money terms it wouldn t have changed anything for them and the room was available it would have made another loyal customer for them it is not great to shoot themselves in the foot by some silly rules that can be adjusted in special circumstances Every customer counts and word of mouth is still the best or worst advert The hotel is called grand but in fact it is a very tired hotel and needs an update badly I would be spending my money somewhere else in the future","This Hotel is advertised as 4 star The room we booked was a standard room It was small the bed was small pillows uncomfortable no air con and the room was hot if the window was open the noise from the street was very loud problems with the plumbing very noisy","Not value for money Room like a cell No air conditioning If there hadn t been a fan to use I would have

might have been my fault although I thought I had booked 2 X single beds They were not helpful in resolving this smoothly and quickly instead focast on charging an extra 40 to 60 GBP We were not impressed and in my 15 years of travel have never experienced this Normally if there are issues on arrival the staff are more than happy to accomodate and move people to assist with their requests This was certainly not the case","radiator in room sounded like a kettle boiling and the air conditioning for the kitchen was outside our window not nice at 5 am accompanied with the smell of cooking complained they did absolutely zero","Food service was very poor Took so long to take order we had to leave and eat elsewhere they didn t take our order Breakfast is far better at a Premier Inn Bed

you imagine Had to talk to 5 people for 2 days before getting a heater on the last and 6th nights there UNACCEPTABLE If this hotel was in the states they would have jumped for a solution Again do not believe the ads","The room was an executive room the wall in the bedroom was damp and marked very disappointed as this was my Daughters 21st Stay in lots of hotels and this was in my opinion definatly like any executive room I have stayed in the hallways near the rooms had peeling paint and looked neglected all though the main areas were very nice","Room too small impossible for two people to get out of bed at once One side tight up against wall No where to put a reachable glass or cup Stayed in better bedrooms in many other places","Unappealing interior decoration of hotel in general and especially the room Was charged about 30 more than booking com stated in booking confirmation","After spending a considerable amount of money at this hotel We checked out and were waiting for our driver to Heathrow that we arranged via the hotel concierge service We bought Starbucks coffee for the long car ride a hotel staff member rudely told us we couldn t have outside drinks and wanted us to have it outside my traveling companion was my 80 year old grandmother and I am pregnant There is no signs in the lobby saying you can t drink outside beverages I will never go back again The worst customer service ever","One of the worst beds every to sleep on The room had no AC which apparently is only offered in upgraded rooms I find that silly and petty Thanks for the fan Overall it was a bit over priced for what you get When one stays in a hotel they usually want a great bed and comfortable room This was below average in both areas The toilet had a heated towel unit that was kept

the reservation for him was canceled by booking com this is not true Moreover a cancellation fee was charged by the reason that my colleague was not arrived on the day After that we protested but the hotel does not accept their mistakes they only explained various contradictory reasons","Hotel room is so humble cannot be matched to 4 stars hotel They couldn t find my reservation on their system took so many times to check in I booked 2 rooms for my family but they gave us one in 4th floor and other one in 5th floor","The staff were came across as literally there to do a job The whole building feels dated I went to my room after a late check in unpacked got ready for bed and then noticed the window was not locked and easily lifted open and there was an adjacent window that I considered accessible The room was also cold as there was no heating other than a small plug in radiator that was giving off a bad smell There was no forewarning of either issue and when I called to swap rooms and suffer the inconvenience of having to re pack and get dressed again this was not an option A suggestion of sending up a maintenance man was put to me but it had already gone 2300 hrs I was a lone female and there was no guarantee of when he would turn up so I hardly slept a wink and am still out of sorts as a result ever since Will not be going back again","To say the room was Executive and the small window looked out onto blank walls was poor The room was quite stark but adequate for the time we spent there","The room was freezing cold and very noisy In the morning I

access in and out of bed at night was impossible without disturbing your sleeping partner no bed side tables for reading matter or glasses cups etc not acceptable in this day and age at the price charged","The reception staff were very cool and to start with not friendly at all a staff member had to come out from the back to book us in even though 3 people were standing behind the counter

With the window open there was something industrial pumping out noise and heat all night just under the window so sleep was impossible There was no air conditioning and when I inquired having booked a single room I was told that there was only air conditioning in double rooms and I should have booked that This was not made apparent when I booked online and also would have meant a significant cost increase in an already expensive hotel Also they charged for ice the ice machine on the 1st floor cost 1 for a small tub of ice I have never stayed in a hotel which charged for ice from the ice machine","generally poor for the price one of the worst large hotels I have stayed in only put comp toiletries for one and there were two of us Had to wait for breakfast then it was fairly poor","Room too small had to ask for an ironing board no fridge and tea and coffee milk was supplied but not adequate bought in from tesco extra across the road","A king sized bed is not the same as 2 singles pushed together Window blinds are supposed to let in light not block half of it out when open Loo rolls are supposed to be accessible from the loo","I specifically requested a non Main Street facing room yet was allocated room 155 which is so noisy it is akin to sleeping outside in the street I had two nights very bad and constantly broken sleep In my opinion this hotel should not even charge for this room as it is unfit for purpose as I doubt anybody could get a good nights sleep given how noisy this room is","Small rooms Avoid the executive breakfast room at all costs The saddest room Prepared to order means that the waitress goes in to the general breakfast room and fills your plate from the buffet Stale bacon cold eggs and so forth Do your self a favour and book a different hotel in the same area","Well don t you dare bring in coffee from an outside shop Starbucks Eats Pret a manger into this hotel You will be promptly asked to go outside or get ride of it Then you will be told that it is like that everywhere HOWEVER we tested 6 other hotels in the area and all of them told us that outside coffee was permitted on site What they call a business center is no business

together when we had booked a double Breakfast was nothing more than chaos We were seated almost on the knees of strangers and the staff were very stressed out Notified reception on checking out but said nothing could be done retrospectively","Booking com made a mistake and booked us in twice Your hotel was very unhelpful even though we only booked one room so NOT our fault I had to pay the cancellation fee Both you and Booking com blaming each other no one taking responsibility Was told the next day by your receptionist that I hadn t been charged a cancelletion fee But can see on my bank statement that I have Now Booking com are reneging and saying that I only had one room booked Great so who s going to refund the 179 17 to me Absolutely disgusted with the treatment It was my

to TV problem at 22 00","The room was hideously small I reserved a standard single after staying in it for 3 days I m sure room 721 is a cosy single That s the hotel s code for a single room which is just slightly larger than a closet The elevated shower you have to climb up into it is tiny a bit of a hazard One slip on soap or water you will fall out of the shower down onto the sink The weather was warm with a breeze but as none blew in the window the room was stifling even with a fan I had to ask for a luggage rack ice bucket as none was provided I had only 1 towel for 3 nights until I

booking in room was a small double No indication on line it was a small double Offered upgrade when booking in but subsequently none available Room suitable for single person only no bedside table partner had to climb over to get in and out Workmen right outside the window on scaffolding drillling and banging so had to keep shutters closed Room not suitable for purpose All the above mentioned

was placed in an area that was being remodeled The area was noisy and it was difficult for me to get rest The rooms were small and not very comfortable","The bed It was tiny and pushed up To the wall It should at least be king size I had to shuffle down the bed to get to the toilet and get a drink of water Even banged my head on the wall","How this hotel has the nerve to charge what it charges is beyond me Perhaps the location is enough to con people into thinking it is lixury but believe me it is not Our room was an internal room looking onwards towards a structure of scaffold and rubbish Anybody could have climbed in through the window as ithat area is obviously accessible otherwise the scaffold or whatever it was wouldn t be there The room felt like a student halls room dark enclosed tires shabby and uncomfortable and had definitely seen better days It certainly seems that if you book with booking com you are punished by being given the worst possible rooms because I certainly hope this was a one off does hole room I would not recommend this hotel Pay a bit more and shop around","Great location The hotel was clean and comfortable although the decor needed a refresh and the

is dull single beds not queen on wheels so moves no aircon but they supply an old fan The duvet has holes in it Absolutely shocking for over 200 as you have to pay a 20 supplement upon check in So 214

supposed to be fully closed luckily the wooden shutters helped 100 for room 1 night only on a Sunday not worth it if I m being honest","We paid a lot of money for an executive room but it was extremely tiny and no bigger than a postage stamp The room was located in the middle of the hotel so we had a tiny window that looked out onto a grubby brick wall therefore the room was dark and dingy

willing to help type of person you d expect The bed was incredibly uncomfortable too twin beds pushed together with no effort to disguise the lumps in the mattress where they met I hate that","no fridge in room booked executive room which should have allowed us into covent garden dining room for breakfast where you order your food with extra choices available however we were shown into main restaurant and told to help ourselves to buffet breakfast I know the covent gdn dining was open but not doing ordered breakfasts I think we still should have been in there if only for the spaciousness and tables with lovely cloths etc the people who were allowed that privilege I can only think that their money must have been worth more than mine or maybe they thought we were hillbillies I have stayed in this hotel many times and thought I would treat ourselves to executive for second time but very disappointed eating arrangements","Shower taps need descaling horrid smell from drains the new booth seating is so unfriendly the older decor made more sense New menu card room dining not advisable limited choice of average food Tea cakes were cold from fridge so cream in the cakes was There were no more small tasty affordable snacks like the crab cakes of tandoori salmon or tatty etc Pity You lost 15 customers who went to eat elsewhere daily for 3 days","The room was cramped and small for two people I would of expected more for the price it would of been 19 00 each for 2nights for breakfast so would of been a extra 36 00 on top of 445 00 we had already paid","I cannot remember having a smaller room or double bed ever in a London hotel Also bed very hard and uncomfortable and this was supposed to have been an upgraded executive room I dread to think what the standard rooms were like I also think being asked for an extra 20 to check into a room earlier than 2pm two and half hours when the room is already available is not good","COSY ROOM WAS MORE LIKE A BOX WITH A SMALL

in the middle of the night We had to evacuate for an hour Things happen but they never communicated to tenants about what was going on It was handled poorly and in an unprofessional manner","The hotel presentation was good in the front reception areas but could do with some serious attention to maintenance in the room we were in on the 4th Floor The room was described as an Executive Room but we have had better quality at well known budget hotels for a lot less money","We took 2 rooms and we asked in advanced that the rooms will be next to each other But the stuff didn t do any effort to help Second the Hotel is very old in furniture Windows are not isolated so you hear the noise from the street the wood in the rooms is old and you can see that no renovation was done in the last years","Bedroom was more like a single A small double bed right up against one wall Window that was virtually blacked out and the top looking at scaffolding No natural light at all Was like being in a cupboard","Sound proofing on rooms is wafer thin You can hear literally everything going on in all rooms around you We were kept awake until 3 30am by one side and then woken again at 6am by the other

complaining we were moved to the 6th floor which was much better though still very small The bed was hard and couldn t compare with Premier Inn the beds of which are superb Disappointing","It is

as I say it is a central London hotel and you get what you pay for","The room was dated and shabby as I work In the city the location although wonderful for theatre goers wasn t really an asset for me I found it very commercial and although the staff were friendly enough I found other guests totally miserable barely able to utter a good morning And funnily enough I haven t experienced that at other hotels in London I wouldn t stay here again not a nice feel The room service food was average presentation rubbish the poor man seemed overworked to say the least","Stayed here a number of times over the years This was without a doubt the worst stay Booked a cosy double which turned out to be a Single room converted into a double by the addition of a double bed against the wall Breakfast was poor and I don t think a member of staff smiled at me across the 3 days","Bathroom was small with VERY little room to stand in the shower one of the worst I ve had while traveling through Europe No bar fridge","Room was very basic for an upgrade to an executive room very small and basic shower room which you would expect to find in a 3 star B B Dirty towels and robe left on the sofa after the room

struggle the next day with no sleep I would not stay again as it was so hot in the room","The room booked wasn t exactly as expected so we had to get an upgrade Breakfast was a shamble Had to wait a long time to be seated despite available tables and a longer time to get tea or coffee After the first day we didn t want to have breakfast in the hotel anymore","Uncomfortable matress very busy and overcrowded restuarant for breakfast thins walls between bedrooms you can hear talking poor quality bathroom refurbishment the new floor tiles where loose and cracked","The soundproofing between rooms is very poor we could hear everything that was happening next door This hotel was basically an overpriced Travelodge","Even though I have requested early check in prior to arrival when I arrived at 7 am after the whole night flight the receptionists told me they cannot do anything and that I should come back around 14 00 when the check in hours starts I was cold and tired and yet needed to wait

another 30 minutes I was too cold and felt uncomfortable I had to wear my coat and called the last time and finally got the portable heater after 2 hours and 30 min waiting and 3 calls I understand if they have to search for it and all but they could at least give me a heads up and let me know what is going on I found the service to be very poor The staff in the hotel were generally not kind or friendly The front desk staff were the worst The check in worker was mumbling and did not speak clearly when talking to me I could not hear what she was saying She didn t look like she wanted to talk to me at all The impression I got was that I SHOULD FEEL SORRY to even ask questions such as where is the gym and do I have to pay for the newspaper Her directions to the Gym for instance were It s there to the right up there somewhere you can find it which I didn t find helpful When I called regarding the heater they sounded very annoyed as well Very frustrating But at least the workers in the breakfast restaurant were very friendly I had around 10 interactions with staff during my stay and other than the personnel in the restaurant all were poor","The small room is really really small Not sound proof at all I could hear everything from the next room including someone snoring and people walking up and down the corridor The toilet is almost obstructing the panel door of the shower

little respite from the stuffiness of the room","The single room was ridiculously small and although I had been told that would receive an upgrade if I paid extra when I arrived and indeed had paid the extra no upgrade to the room had been applied","We had a room which we booked only the dat before however it was like a building site outside the window and at 8 30am in the morning builders working in an adjoining room started work banging and drilling so I made a complaint at reception when checking out If you really value mine wife s custom then feel more than an apology from reception staff is required","They tried to put me in an Executive room which had the sound of men drilling shouting and banging just outside the window How they expected guests to tolerate that plus the scaffolding outside the window makes the room insecure","No Aircon with temperature 30C and above shower temperature not consistent hot cold every 5 6 seconds wooden panel at windows can t be shut

was on the 1st floor and window could not be opened probably because of scaffolding and work being done outside We switched rooms Second room was a few floors up but still not able to open the window facing the scaffolding Therefore we woke up the next morning sweating buckets and no air to speak of window could not be opened We switched rooms for the third time There the window could be opened but unfortunately the bed was still lumpy The bar on the right was ok but please tell the staff to change the muzak and lower the volume and relax with the cold air blowing down on the guests No wonder very few guests hang out there it used to be very busy there all the time And what is the idea of keeping signs directing guests to an Indian restaurant but only when standing in front of the door to the restaurant do you realize the restaurant is closed a sign on the door","The staff argued stating that we did not have a room booked for 2 people even after I showed them the booking com

for cramped bad bed causing us back pains The bed was tiny and getting in was a chore","View from our room 394 was a builders site with scaffolding at our window we had to keep our wooden shutters closed all the time or we had workmen looking in at us we couldn t stay in bed after 8 30 and we couldn t have a nap in the afternoon due to the noise of the work taking place","The hotel lobby and bar areas are very nice It s an old historic hotel The standard rooms are very basic and you the walls are thin It s a no frills sleeping room with no decor The bed linens were old and they didn t use a top sheet just a top comforter that we all know rarely gets washed I turned the lights on several times in the night to ensure there were no bedbugs The bathroom was outdated and very tight space I

had some maintenance issues with the room","It was incredibly noisy not only the road noise but the people in next door room who kept us awake until the early hours when we asked to be moved Ruined our weekend","The hotel states 4 star but service and facilities more 3 star Had booked Executive Double however the room was not good very dark and tiny window faced a wall and constant hum from hotels air con units The room next door had Executive label whereas our room did not making me wonder if they had added a coffee maker to a standard double as hotel was full It did not match images of executive room I complained and was told no other executive doubles available and got the feeling that this was because I had booked via Bookings com rather than hotel direct It took 45 minutes to get an alternative room a standard not executive double which was better as faced front of hotel this confirmed my feelings about the executive double room they gave me being a re labelled standard room because they were full I then had to argue for a refund on difference in room price waiting to have it credited back and benefits of executive room booking all disappeared once I moved rooms no record of me on breakfast list tried to charge for newspaper and no 10 discount which was supposed to be applied on food drink in hotel","They over charged me The agreed rate was 165 They required me to pay over 200 So there was some failure of communication between yourselves and the hotel I had not taken the details to London and couldn t remember offhand so I paid the increase The hotel would no doubt say that we had breakfast on top which is correct but only because they told us it was included in the rate","Requested a quite King room but was given the choice for a noisy king or quiet twins Thank goodness the room bathroom was super clean which helped us to enjoy the room a bit more Great Location as well","The room was nothing like the advert that enticed me to go ahead and book Not sure how it could be charged or called an executive room We would have expected chairs not taking turns to sit on the one available which was really uncomfortable The room was drab again nothing like your advert it was not worth the money at all we would not like to have seen a standard room if this was the quality of Executive The window casement was broken and so the top part of the window kept slipping down safety sign a bit ironic really We would not recommend these rooms to anyone who is planning to spend any time in the hotel better off sitting in the foyer","The room was very masculine the tap was lose and the glass in the bathroom had mouldy in the bottom for the price the quality was poor but maybe you had to pay more because of the location the drilling outside till 3am was awful but not the hotels fault but the early morning hoovering after the late night was very disturbing I guess they cleaners had to do their job but not slit if sleep for this pricy room","The only light that worked in my room 528 was the bathroom light I had to leave the door open or sit on the toilet seat to read my book I came back around 12 30 pm and it seems nothing had been done with the light after I rported it","Room was poor 409 I asked to move and was told they were full Noisy I could hear the conversation going on in the next room when the tv was turned down I had previously asked reception to request they turn their tv down but soon realised it was not because it was loud it was because the wall was paper thin Room was very basic and of a lesser quality than a Premier Inn totally overpriced","The room was very cramped and overheated The staff rushed off their feet as the hotel was incredibly busy The concierge was particularly uncooperative","The bed was hard the pillows tired the walls paper thin and the room stuffy and poorly ventilated The duvet cover had a hole in it and needed to be retired The checkout receptionist was also quite abrupt which was a change from the check in staff unfortunately A grumpy lady at the breakfast sitting made us feel unwelcome but luckily was made up for by cheerful staff internally","Executive Room was more like a closet Double Room also very small Ordering sparkling water at the lobby should come in a bottle not a glass","The room i booked was tiny which is fine but was a bit of a shock when opening the door would be good if you were told when booking just how small the room is Also as it s standard in most reputed hotels these days to have a few various phone charger wires available for guests at reception i didn t expect to be laughed frowned at when asking for one when mine had broken not to mention have to go out late night to get one","No a c no towels pokey room misinformation re case storage overbearing receptionist at second check in 24 8 2016 Revolting view cleaners store room should have been left closed very unsightly","We where really disappointed with the bedroom we had it was a treat night away we got given a queen bed that was made up of 2 single beds and was really uncomfortable with the gap in the middle when your time like ours is so precious you just want it to be perfect but I feel strongly that if your offering queen beds that is what they should be I would of rather had a double bed which would of made our experience staying there more pleasurable I feel the location for what we need was very good the Buffett breakfast was very good too","The room It was more like a student room on a university campus than a hotel room No curtains but wooden shutters not solid period ones bed pushed against the wall as this was the only way a double would fit in no air conditioning generally other hotels locally represent better value for money and much better comfort","Older staff disjointed Night staff some trouble with English and basic service Small rooms No AC","Breakfast was very overcrowded and we were at a folding table and event chairs in a hot windowless room Even though breakfast was paid for we only took it once and ate out for the other breakfasts Bed mattress was very tired Housekeeping was variable first night we had no water second night we did","Bar closes at 11 when you have spent a lot of money on a nice meal that didn t really start until 9 it was ridiculously rushed on the end no time to repair for the evening","the matress

sometimes we got water sometimes not","The price was too much for a single room with tiny window that you can t even see anything It was too noticeable that the very end of the leftover space was used for this single room","Cleanliness of towels Major lack of sound proofing as next to an extremely loud couple who talked very loudly woke me up at 5am with their conversation and they were so loud we could hear that they had booked a Chinese for that evening Sadly these things effect your stay","The rooms are a little on the small side and very basic Furnished in a similar style and standard to a budget motel The biggest negative is that the rooms do not have air conditioning you have to rely upon a cooling fan that can be found in the bottom of the wardrobe If arriving by car you have to plan your arrival with military precision as there are no parking facilities and no drop off point at the front of the hotel","The room was extremely small and not very comfortable standard single room But maybe that s what you get for 200 pounds in this location","The Wi fi is offered free but it does not work most of the time You must begin connection all the time you want to use it If you are not

man who doesnt do his make up Not good for a woman","Very small room Old and outdated bathroom utilities Wind was coming through the window a little bit","The room didn t offer anything that a Travelodge wouldn t Our room 433 also used to be an interconnecting room and the door had been sealed up but the sound proofing was poor","The room was pretty basic despite the fact I was given an upgrade to a Queen not sure why I still had two single beds only","Design of the Hotel Rooms Very dated not tastefully renovated Bathrooms are ridiculous small Overall very bad lighting furniture and interior is very weak Stains on the carpet Breakfast in the morning was crowded felt like a typical tourist hotel with standard food Quality is okay Very Disappointed There are way better Hotels in

very limited considering todays technology requirements Wifi although was available wasn t that adequate The very big downer was the breakfast certainly not worth the 18 00 charged Previous reviews have said that the toaster needed urgent attention as it was very poor at doing the job well it s obvious that this hasn t been addressed as it only churned out very dry bread claiming it was toast

date","Rooms were small and not very comfortable Prices in the bar were expensive 74 for 3 drinks avoid the Gin Palace bar","room overlooking the strand could do with some decent double glazing bit noisy could hear everything from adjoining room","It was cold We had booked afternoon tea for 5 but only 4 came We were waiting at least 20 mins for the missing one to arrive There was a mix up with

did complain it was logged but just forgotten Nice hotel but inconsiderate management we were promised discount if we stayed again ignored no reply s to e mails really disappointed it s no way to treat customers l m sure we will receive better service in another hotel","Expensive for a very small room Poor ventilation very noisy both from the hallway and adjoining rooms plus whining motor noise all night Not traffic some kind of pump or refrigerator motor from an adjoining courtyard Paid 20 on arrival for an early checkin but if the room is ready it should simply be made available its too expensive already Landing early from long haul flight no fun waiting until 2pm for some rest Bag collection from storage was painfully slow and a charge of 2 to store ur case for the day Cash grab an included service everywhere else Building generally tired inside needs a lick of paint and fresh carpets in hallways","I ve stayed in other hotels in the area for approx 40 60 cheaper if I m honest so I was a little disappointed with the cost the late normal check in time The room was very basic I was also woken up at 8am by the housekeeping staff talking very loudly in the corridor evidently

there was very patronising called me darling twice obviously thought he could dump me as I was alone One of the reasons I go to this hotel in an executive room Is s so I can use the executive dining room which I enjoy I did not take breakfast in the room he put me in","The bed The shower Not up to hotel standard I am afraid The mattress was lumpy and was starting to collapse Lets put it this way

where Not great is an understatement","No air conditioning in the room single beds narrow","Small room","Bed not the best Very small rooms No temperature control in rooms","No Negative","Our executive room was gloomy and brown with minimal natural light quite small for the extra cost It looked out onto concrete walls A slightly larger executive room was available but only on payment of a supplement and the view was the same Breakfast could have been a treat but it was quite bland and served in an over crowded drab backroom Also one lift wasn t operating for two days causing delays so we used the stairs a lot On reflection we I may have had unrealistic expectations for a room in central London However like many visitors to the capital staying here was meant to be part of a special occasion for an important anniversary Overall the hotel was fine no real cause for concern just a little underwhelming","The rooms were so small It was advertised as a cosy double but it was more like a very very cosy single There was no air con in the room and the rooms got very stuffy and warm quickly didn t affect us a whole pile because we were out most of the day but we were lucky the weather was mild and not roasting Also on the last day house keeping came at 9am to clean the room despite us not having to be out until 12 She came back then again at 10am for which I got annoyed","In London it s hot

Palace is well worn very busy and holds hundreds of guests It needs updating with dingy corridors and dorm style room configuraitons It is typical London small rooms older furnishing like being in your grandparents house But be careful as they overcharge given the post code of the Hotel but if you book late the rates drop significatly since its really not comparable to the Savoy or other 5star options","I arrived about 13 30 and was told a room would be ready in half an hour I went out and came back at 16 00 only to be told I hate to wait another hour I was not pleased and the receptionist found a room which was ready","I booked a cosy double room It was definitely cosy if not a little dated The room was overlooking a courtyard I think but that couldn t really be seen due to the scaffolding all outside the window which made the room really dark The windows wouldn t stay open making the room stifling hot but there was a desk fan and we used rolled up towels to prop the window open","No AC in a small room with a window that can t be opened for security reasons The room was unbearably warm and it wasn t even that warm outside Had I not prepaid I would have moved out immediately Otherwise good hotel as would be expected","My partner is quite a lot younger than me and the check in girl asked twice if we wanted two rooms and once if we wanted twin room as if we had somehow made a mistake booking a king size room We don t mind a comment occasionally about our age gap but the fact this girl asked 3 times in a short time upset my partner None of her business at all For reference we are age 40 and 23","The rooms are a bit dated and don t have air conditioning Our window opened but right onto the Strand which is a very busy and noisy road","The room that we had in the first night was the smallest for two persons that I have ever experienced With paying some extra we got a better room for the following two nights That was a decent one However because there was

has everything you need","Small room Could hear conversation of people in the adjacent room Window which was screwed shut looked out onto courtyard which was a building site with scaffolding and walkways right up to the window Really not value for money","The cosy double bedroom was poky and depressing Also no good for twin beds Realised why it was comparatively cheap Big anonymous hotel","The room was tiny Smallest I ve seen outside of Japan But it was fine for our purposes as we didn t spend a lot of time there The TV was at a right angle to the bed and impossible to watch

bathroom was not the cleanest it could have been It was very expensive but guess you re paying for location rather than comfort","It was very dusty and generally didn t feel very clean The bed was just OK and the sofa bed was terrible The temperature in the room was hard to control due to there only being a radiator which was quite filthy","For the price I have had better breakfasts not that it was bad but I have had better and for the price I feel it should have been really The coffee was hot black but completely tasteless The window of the room was boarded with shutters at the sides and only the centre section would open which was a bit prison like The bathroom extractor did not work and the quilt was a bit on the small side only just fitting the bed Overall it was all ok as a 3 star hotel not a 4 as advertised and for the price it was not really up to it","It s right on the main street and very loud late into the morning hours which kept me up Traffic is terrible so don t plan on taking transportation Everything should be done by foot or walk to the nearest subway If your luggage isn t heavy that shouldn t be a problem The rooms are outdated and quite small Bed isn t very comfortable and the shower is a step up which I imagine would be too short for a taller person I m not sure how this is a four star hotel It seemed like almost a college dorm room I was renting","This hotel has seen better days It is worn down and the rooms and hallways need renovation The whole hotel smells of a weird soap smell which usually means that they are hiding some other smell","I guess thin walls between the rooms I heard everything happening at neighbors room o","Our room was very dark and stuffy and overlooked some huge extractor fans As the room was so warm we had to have the window open which meant we could hear these fans all night","The room is described as cosy you could just about swing a cat in it There was an old fan in the corner which represented the ventilation

Pillows were very uncomfortable Wall very thin so you can hear the people next to you No air conditioning you just have a fan Cooked Breakfast was not good Buffet service eggs undercooked and food

small should be the word not cozy Bath rooms dated as well So for the money I won t be staying again","Do not rely on the pictures as a guide as the rooms are smaller than pictured Not great value for

floor with barely any view on the court wall and sunlight next to the maids room quite noisy unless you plan to study Polish 4 star price for a one star situation Check the room floor and situation if you can","I asked for a quiet room Away from lifts It was away from lifts but it wasn t quiet There was noise from either air conditioning units or electrical unit It woke me up a couple of times I cant put my finger on what the noise was but it did disturb my sleep Left luggage not very well run bit chaotic Little bit dismissive surly","Room was quite basic and small even though we was given an upgrade for the price we paid was hoping for something a bit more spacious","On arrival we were met with a queue of people all being told their rooms were not read this was at 14 00 the designated time for booking in and that there would be a wait of no more than 1 hour 1 1 4 hours later I again approached he reception desk only to be told that my room was still not ready I was not happy with this and after a discussion with the reception manager another room was found for me and my husband We are both pensioners and had already had a 3 hour journey into London What we didn t need was this delay without even an offer of a cup of tea coffee whilst we waited Not a good start especially for a hotel of this standing","Room was insufferably hot Even the fan was not enough to cool it down Bed was not always fresh and comfortable Some staff members were not that friendly","We had a meal in the carvery unfortunately the food was just warm We complained but it was not much better although edible Vegetables could have been cooked more After further complaint we did get 50 of the food bill Breakfast in hotel was excellent though On our second night we went to Simpsons opposite where we have been a number of times and had a perfect meal Catering staff in the Strand Palace could learn a lot from those in Simpsons","To small rooms Very thin doors to the bathroom and you hear everything And thin doors out to the hallway got woken up 0600 in the morning","Fre alarm went off at 06 14 which disrupted my sleep Staffs did however manage it well and it came out to be a system fault at their basement","on arrival we had to wait over an hour after the check in time for our room as it was not ready we were given a soft hot drink When we did finally get into our room whilst unpacking and getting refreshed to go out as we were by now running late another hotel guest managed to access our room with their allocated room card This was brought to the attention of the reception who blocked our card and were looking into how this happened","Very small room Vending power plug adaptors for BP 8 which you can buy on the streets for BP 3 It would be so much nicer if you could just

verge of breaking","Room was extremely basic considering the location and also how the hotel looks within the reception area The walls to the next room are also very thin as could hear people talking next door","Bathroom facilities look tired Breakfast was poor under cooked eggs and generally not of a standard for a central London hotel charging these room rates","The room was noisy I could clearly hear all the time when somebody closed the door in another room nearby I woke up at night several times because of this","View was hoping for a view of something strand or Thames had a view of square of other rooms and daylight was way up we must have been in middle of hotel Thought room would have been a bit bigger","The room was very hot There was no fan in the bathroom so after a shower bath it was too steamed up and we weren t able to use the mirror","The lounge bar was dated and not overly comfortable Breakfast a good selection but tasteless fruit","Room was very small although it was very clean","Room very small and it wasn t the smallest one available at that bed very small and could ve been positioned better in the room as the bed was pushed against the wall so you felt you were squashed into the corner of the room No extractor working in the bathroom and had to shut the bathroom door at night otherwise it made the room like a fridge","Very very cold in the bathroom Windows do not isolate properly just 1 glass very old never saw such old windows in such good hotel Heater absolutely insufficient for heating the bathroom","Should have known that cosy room was a euphemism for small but I didn t expect the bed to be against a wall so I had to shuffle to the bottom of the bed or climb over my husband to get in or out","Having to climb over the wife to get into or out of bed Extreamly poor and certainly not 4 star quality Double room was a single at best and not for persons with limb difficulties","Our room was very small and check in was very slow with long lines Breakfast was also fair not sure it was worth paying for Given the price I was hoping for a more posh hotel it was pretty basic The walls were also quite thin I could hear my neighbor s phone conversation in Chinese starting at 5am Still given the location the room size and price were probably to be expected","I was very annoyed at the cleaner waking us up at 8 20 in the morning when we had travelled a distance the night before and were due to travel back that evening When we mentioned it before leaving in reception they had no idea with what to do with the complaint Was ment to be a relaxing weekend away but was made to feel uncomfortable for sleeping there","You pay for the location not so much the comfort Uncomfortable bed and pillows and I m not fussy usually I sleep anywhere and everywhere","in need of a facelift the corridors were shabby and carpets dirty sweet wrapper on floor in my room bed and pillows very average bathroom very tight and poorly ventilated towels quite

again","The bed was to hard and the pillows as well No shelf at the bathroom to set your toilet bag Have to set it on the floor","The room standard twin was the smallest I have ever stayed in anywhere in the world Impractical room and bathroom","Check in very slow long queue and then room wasn t ready We felt room was very small for twin beds and the ensuite even smaller although it did have a good size shower cubicle Duvets were not wide enough to cover us once in the beds and room was draughty due to very old window frame despite a wooden shutter being placed over it","Expensive for a single room but I suppose its because its London where some things are over the top cost","Cosy Room a bit too cosy no room to swing a kitten let alone a cat Promised a view of the Strand below but unable to see street due to wall in front of the window","The business centre is just computers in the stair well and there was a block on the communication websites I needed for banking and to get into my internet account The reception staff did not know what to do but the IT tech said he would try and unblock it as it happens all the time Perhaps the staff need to know Block the porn but not access for international guests that need to do business in Australia in the middle of the night The night porter let me use his computer which was helpful","A bit overpriced and the reception lady wasn t very welcoming It was my birthday too so just a bit of an anti climax","The cosy room was cramped I did not expect this in a 4 hotel There was of course no view Despite the info given on the square footage which will not mean much to some people prospective travellers should be warned","We went with friends both payed 225 for bed and breakfast the rooms did not compare the manager was not

like libraries","there were not water bottoles on the first and second night although I asked staff So on the third day I bought one bottle at bar Then I got them This is one of examples Although I asked staff I could not get their service","For the amount of money we paid for one night for five people the rooms were very ordinary Our rooms were very pokey on different floors and very hot with only tiny little windows looking out on to scaffolding It would be nice to have a top sheet on the bed as it gets very hot with a doona but is nice to have a cover","No air conditioning in our room that s just not acceptable in any clinste","Walls are quite thin and room was very hot Had to use fan which was already in the room but this was a little noisy","There was no air conditioning in the

in Summer but felt it was expensive","No parking facilities No a c in bedroom Noisy construction work starts early 7 30 am We had to lug our bags about 50 meters to the front door because it is on a bus lane and we did not know about the side entrance","It takes quite a lot of people and the rooms are pretty small We got a room with a view to the Strand and it is constantly very noisy as the windows don t isolate very well Overall I feel it is a bit too pricey for what you get like most places in London","Some areas of the hotel are quite dark but overall very good Lifts were not all working so took a little while","Two things to keep in mind only certain rooms have air conditioning others have fans in closets When the weather is very warm and humid that s a problem Also Strand Avenue is a very busy and noisy road with lots of pubs and drinkers And they get very loud very late And a general comment for Americans British people drink coffee with milk if you want cream you

which is going on outside in the internal side of the building","The noise when trying to sleep","Didn t agree with the 12 5 service charge added to bill I realise it was optional but you don t always look at your bill in detail just the end figure then you have paid it without wanting too","I was disappointed that as someone who has stayed at the SP when visiting London on previous occasions no recognition was allowed for that I was placed in perhaps the worst room in the whole place on the top floor looking out at scaffold and workmen able to look in No mention was made of the early morning banging I was out during the day evening No doubt had I been a name of influence more consideration would have been given to room allocation","Room too small for two medium sized but elderly adults Lavatory shower room very small Room situated at rear therefore subject to delivery collection noises at 6 00 am Otherwise quite quiet Food and service good","That I wanted to change date of hotel stay because my daughter had different hols to me and I didn t realise I sent 3 emails to them they didn t reply and yourselves tried rang bit they wouldn t budge","On arrival we were told the room we had requested was unavailable and could not be provided for us as the hotel was overbooked After we complained the very helpful manageress sorted us out with a very adequate alternative Annoyed however that booking com had offered the rooms online when obviously the hotel didn t actually have them We realise it can take time for the system to update but we had booked over 24 hrs ahead The hotel is rather dated and in need of a facelift modernisation to ask the current tariff for a room","Breakfast was like a kettle market Shower cubicle small Porter walked with me for cases yet I carried them","Location of the room and there was a waste line which was concealed behind a wall in the room so there was always the sound of a tap running water Was generally a lot of noise around the room Check Clerk mixed up my name with another guest and allocated me to wrong room which had a later check out date that took forever to change Asked for a late check out after a 4 day stay and had to pay 10 pounds per hour extra Then got locked out after 12 00 noon as the Clerk ever extended the access to the room Apologies with no consideration","Directions to the room were not clear at all I have no idea how they number the rooms but it s like a maze I wandered around various corridors for ages I objected to being charged 20 for early check in I didn t request it it was just that the room was ready when I arrived there s a difference As usual single rooms were stuck at the back with a view of 4 walls 4 90 for a cappuccino in the bar was a bit much and lukewarm Bathroom was very dated all the fittings were tarnished","The bedroom and bathroom were extremely small with very little room to move around The quilt on the bed was far too small for two people to share","My cosy

sleep Like concrete Didn t like queuing for breakfast Would have liked veggie sausages","Room was a bit on the small side but not a major issue as only used to sleep in","I thought for the price we paid for the Executive Room it would have been a bit better The room had scaffolding outside although I understand that the hotel needs to be maintained it felt a bit unsafe as the window lock where broken The bathroom was clean but a bit shabby","The room was described as cosy but it would be more accurately described as small and almost claustrophobic That may be what I booked but if do it was inadvertent Definitely too cramped","Bit busy in the peak time e g Morning lifts crowded You can hear the guests in the other rooms but not too much","It is quite expensive but I guess that is London On the second night I stayed on the 7th floor ceiling was low especially in the shower for a 6 3 man","My room was windowless which gave me a closed in feeling","The room we were originally offered had a view onto another wall and had scaffolding outside with workmen banging etc We asked to be moved and they offered us the only other executive double which was better You would think the better rooms would not look out onto a wall We ate prior to going to the theatre It took 45 minutes to come and was pretty awful in quality","the single room i had was just too small could be slightly bigger not much space to move around in and small closet space also bathroom very small","The walls are paper thin Could hear neighbour using toilet coughing and watching television at 3 in morning There are hundreds of rooms and therefore SO many people at hotel Wait for breakfast wait for check in and no room at bar in evening Not a great place for me as got very little sleep and I needed sleep to be prepared for my conference","Early check in was 20 Most other hotels would check you in for free if a room was available","No Daught beer at the 2 bars There is a sports bar on the corner of the hotel and you can book drinks to your room but not conducive to a relaxing drink returning to the hotel late","No warning sign for step outside door when no doorman present I fell flat on my face Poor selection of cereals at breakfast no muesli or granola terrible coffee","Breakfast was expensive scrambled egg and bacon was cold Did not find out until leaving could have had full english breakfast in attached cafe for 5 75 In hotel lift a poster showing 15 pounds voucher and lower price for booking direct with hotel","Our room was tiny for the money we paid for it 400 for 2 nights without breakfast I understand you pay for location but we still felt stung with such a small basic room not quite like the ones in the pictures Lady who checked us in wasn t very friendly or helpful and I could see she was irritated by us wanting to split the bill","We saw 4 rooms during our stay and have to say the final rooms allocated were far from perfect in comparison to what we had already seen We were a family and ideally we were requesting 2 rooms next to each other They found this combination however one room was absolutely tiny especially the bathroom with faulty faucet and the other room had a door that didn t close easily","Central heating not working in the bedroom very cold when we first arrived There was an oil filled radiator in the room which was OK but took a long time to warm the room it should have been switched on before we arrived","The fact we were upgraded for additional cost and given a room that was very noisy was a big disappointment And when challenged about it they know all about it very poor","First non smoking room I was given reeked of smoke Room was changed with no argument and second room was good","Building work being carried out had to keep shutters closed 24 7 Extractor fan in bathroom not working My partner is gluten free not catered for","The central heating system didn t work There was a mobile heater but this couldn t be left on while we were out for safety reasons so we returned to a cold room The bathroom was not as clean as we usually get at this hotel","Quite a high step in and out of the shower which was a little difficult to negotiate","The walls were so thin that I could actually hear both sides of the telephone conversation the person next door was having No good for a romantic break The cooked breakfast was very poor Bacon totally over cooked Tomatoes under cooked Poor quality produce","The pillows where hard the rooms dated and although we paid more for an executive room we seemed to be next to the service stairway It was really loud from quite early hours","The Size of room I felt like I was in a cabin on a ship not at all what I expected from a 5star hotel Two single beds with a small table separating them and about a metre to walk round room one side of room to shower door","The bed was small also the duvet wasn t big enough for both of us also i think the price was abit much for a standard room","Lots of road noise despite being on the sixth floor Light was shining through the door to the room from the cortidor","I found my executive room very cramped There was very little space between my bed and my suitcase and the end of the bed and the desk I was however grateful for the window looking onto the street outside That helped to alleviate the claustrophobic feeling","Upgraded from cosy double to standard and that was small When there were a lot of guests breakfast looked tired as wasn t replenished enough It was fine when not so busy","The room and double bed where very small for 2 of us that are on the short side anyone over 6ft would struggle with the short bed in particular Breakfast was just very average and not hot at all plus we where all sqeezed in to a small area with tiny tables","First room offered right next to noisy ventilation duct Changed immediately without any fuss by receptionist Copious buffet breakfast lacked finesse inevitable I suppose with mass catering","It was expensive The room was small","We were a little shocked to find the bar very expensive we spent 20 on two baileys liqueurs which we thought more than necessary","Checking in at reception was a very slow process especially if you arrive before your room was ready Others were queueing because their room wasnt ready at 2pm Our teenage daughter was with us in a separate room and we had pre asked for her room to be close which they ignored but changed when asked again","Terrible bathroom a almost 1 step up into the shower with a metal tract for the shower door My mother slipped on the wet floor and has a terrible cut on her leg that will need an operation we had to ask for extra no slip mats","A bit of renovation was needed overall","Bed was hard pillows almost non existent The rooms are quite small for the price","I appreciate that it was a single room but quite cramped possibly too much in there for the size of the room","Found the receptionist on booking in very condescending and blanked my partner throughout the booking in process Cosy room is just that small and the shower is of no use to anyone over the height of 5 10 simply too low Bed was uncomfortable and small double","The picture on the booking site is quite deceiving The pictures potray it as very eclectic young colourful and morden but that is far from the truth The decor is quite old and smells musty almost like a nursing home","Room was extremely small windows were very dirty Over priced for the facilities not a 4 star hotel more like a 3 star","The cozy room was a single room you needed to climb over each other to get in or out of the bed as it was against the wall Did get a better room for an extra 30 per night","The double bed was narrow The breakfasts were very standard with few fresh vegetables and limited selection of cheeses","The wardrobe was far too small our clothes barley fitted in It took 1 5 hours to have an iron and ironing board delivered Breakfast is overpriced","There were a few guests who arrived back to our floor very late They were very noisy too","We requested an executive quiet room but were allocated a room next door to the elevator shaft This meant we were kept awake from 4 30am Shattered when we arrived back home","The arrangement of executive breakfast for some guests was divisive The staff could have listened more to our requests and taken on board our concerns The lady on check out had a very bad attitude","Carpet all over the place Computers under maintenance for the majority of the stay","Small room No A C this is usually not an issue in London but I was there during warm weather The room had a small fan which was fine but for a much warmer day it wouldn t have been enough Does London ever have much warmer days I don t know","the room given was classed as a Executive king the room was awful 101 then put in 802 if I remember awful view light none existent eventually given room 204 a king

repair The bathroom door is broken The shower makes funny sound Breakfast area can get crowded","The room was a cosy room I anticipated a small room but I didn t quite understand that meant you could only get in one side of the bed double Apart from this the room was fine good ensuite clean and well presented and fine for an overnight stay","Had to change rooms three times as two too small for 2 people and not air conditioned and consequently had to pay for an upgrade All rooms should be air conditioned and would not stay in the warmer months if cooling could not be guaranteed Our departure was day roads closed for bicycle ride Our lugagge was wheeled to cnr of The Strand and Aldwych to catch a taxi to St Pancras After 20 mins no taxi My travelling companion is 79 and couldn t walk so I

in future as this guarantees that such a request will be ignored Good choice of food for breakfast but it would be a rare treat if for once the so called hot food was actually hot not lukewarm I could do without the overly officious behaviour of the manager in the breakfast area if I visit again","That although we asked quite in advance a room we booked and paid the executive one with a view they gave us a room with a small window looking to an airway The explanation provided by reception was that there was no availability however why they didn t inform us earlier about it Also it was not

leave it in luggage area and got a taxi back to pick luggage up to get back to London Paddington station for 12 30 and no one was on luggage area so we missed our 12 30 train and then which made us miss our connection the other side so not very happy with that","Long line during check in Super slow free internet Terrible mobile signal for O2 Super small bathroom in their standard single rooms No

trip Furthermore unwilling to keep your name and or help you find another hotel visitor to share the taxi cost I stayed 6 nights and if I had not asked for a change of sheets they would not have done it Horrible brand of shampoo and body cream and terrible packaging no pleasant smell bags do not stand on the shower tray and they make a mess when squeezed What is wrong with a broad bottom bottle to stand on the rails of the tray rather than always slipping through the rails and landing on the shower floor Irritating not to be able to switch TV channels without the big screen showing and to have

sleep","Very noisy cleaners early in the morning and kept trying to get into the room Maybe update cleaners on who has and hasn t checked out","This older property only has air conditioning in the lobby so in summer and warmer days of spring you ll be using the provided oscillating fan and an open window to cool off There is a heating radiator for winter I think my son was a little disappointed that the rooms were rather Spartan compared to the sparkling lobby but a hotel should never be the reason for your travel","With being only overnight we did not have any qualms","Second time to stay here 4th floor is far more dated than the 2nd Smaller old fashioned room Could hear the people next door","The sound insulation was very poor I could hear exactly what was going on in the next bathroom and felt like I was sleeping in the corridor with the noise from passing people Also the solid wooden shutters at the window made the room really dark","Our room was called a cosy room which was basically small which we didn t mind However Unfortunatley the walls a paper thin we had very noisy people next door we had to complain the last night ask the staff to sort it out which they did But they continued been loud then decided to have the tv on It was after 4 when all went quite we could then get some sleep","Rooms are very small but they are ok for London standards Lobby decor is

already more expensive that I should have been allowed to stay without paying an extra 60","Expensive bars Staff with English as a first language are rare very rare here Waitresses can misunderstand All are well turned out polite and friendly but they need a better understanding of what you are ordering it shouldn t be this hard","Rooms are very small but adequate and it is central london","This was my second stay at the Strand After checking in this time I notified Reception that there was a very musty smell coming from the bathroom and requested I needed help with this that the room window be opened I kept it open to combat the mustiness which never left I probably should have requested a different room as along with hay fever issues the mustiness led to a lot of chest congestion and coughing now back home for a day am much better","They gave only one set of towel suddenly for one day Usually two sets No traveler s information at all map etc In the restaurant for breakfast queue management was not good and tables were dirty and sticky","The constant loud pinging of lifts Had to switch rooms as I was there on business and first room was too noisy No view from either room No

It wasn t the best nights sleep I ve had","Breakfast was uninspring no decent bakery only cooked food and cereals We had a conference and the rooms are all downstairs with no windows and very poor lighting The food for lunch was totally inappropriate pies and chips and minimal salad something fresh and lighter would have been much better I noticed there was a lot of food left over","Our bedroom was too small we did not had bedside tables and one side of the bed was just next to the wall and my husband kicked with the legs and head during the night Our friends traveled with us at the same time and had a bigger bedroom for the same price","Our room was a double Housekeeping only left one set of towels and she wasn t at all happy when I asked for another set She did bring them though","bathroom door completely blocked inside of small space doorstop dangerous very annoying door should be hung on opposite side of frame or sliding door used as a single person room i did not need to be closing bathroom door all the time to have enough space inside to access the handbasin","the strength of the water from the power shower surprised me but some may like it as strong as that","Price of cocktails and spirits where the same price of The Savoy hotel which I don t feel is justified and air condition would be great","Room is small and breakfast is expensive Its better to

locations were pleasant as were the staff","had breakfast the second morning of our stay in the executive breakfast room this was very poor compared to the selfservice which was very good value","Beds a little hard House keeping staff were a bit noisy in the hallway and started knocking on doors to clean at about 7 30 every morning even weekends which i think is a bit early Location and friendly portiers and concierges made it worth the price though","No complaints no mini bar for snacks but the in room cookies were nice","Room was very cramped and the view out of our window was of a stained courtyard filled with vents and what looked like aircon units Hardly the dynamic city view we were after","No Negative","Waitress in restaurant at breakfast quite rude Tea and coffee left sitting on a table waiting to be served not fresh or hot","Booked a double room although small the room no bigger than a glorified single room the double bed was one side stuck to the wall it felt like we eere in

could do with hiring a proper bar man woman","Breakfast could be more interesting and would like a faster check in","Not much the hotel is great and we alwasy stay here when we visit London We are repeat customers","The towels in the bathroom were rather rough","The room was a lot smaller than the images made out also the view from our window was very poor maybe stait that the room u r booking

room small mattress very hard and light from corridor shone through door all night Bathroom could do with updating walls are thin as per others comments but as facing inside and on 8 th floor no road noise","Cleaning team making too much noise on corridor","Check out was a little rushed no time wasted on pleasantries We weren t in a hurry but the staff were we weren t even asked whether we had a nice trip","The room especially the bed was a bit on the small side for the price but at the same time I can understand the price as its so close to all major attractions","I booked and paid for 3 twins we received two doubles one room had not been touched from the previous occupants The staff did manage to sort but I would have been nice not to have","If the bed wasn t against the wall it would make it easier to get out of bed without disturbing your partner The rooms need to be slightly bigger to allow more room for the bed","The hairdryer my wife used cut out continuously which meant it took a long time to dry her hair The room was small but quite adequate the bed was very comfortable generally ok","The noise of the night bus going over the manhole cover every hour","The WiFi was worse than when I stayed last year It isn t free and available throughout The WiFi couldn t be accessed from my room and only very slowly and intermittently in the foyer and bar In addition a speed of 7 Mbs is pitiful for an operation like the Strand Palace to be giving customers in this day and age The reception staff have a plan of which indicates rooms with limited WiFi so if the problem is known about why not do something about it","We had the cosy double room I m 6ft 4 and I was happy with the room until stepping into the shower in which I had to crouch in because the shower ceiling was so low and couldn t physically stand up straight in I knew I was getting the costly room but didn t expect the shower also to be part of the cosy package","the rooms are noisy with both street noise and corridor noise everything works but the bathroom equipment is on the old side Carpet could be a little cleaner For an average motel these points would be ok but for the price of this place still cheap for London one expects a little better or maybe this is just central London prices who knows Also the information the guys at the baggage hold gave us about public transport was incorrect","Woken up by cleaning staff by knocking on the door and entering the room","Room size rather small for the money it cost could be a lot less the smaller the room","Room was very small and not what we booked we got a queen bed instead of two singles and it virtually took up the whole room The booking was for my wife and her sister and they managed but not what we asked for The room was opposite the laundry and piles of sheets were everywhere including at the entrance to the room","The receptionist when sorting our room said that the one he was allocating had a bath rather than a shower which we said we were happy with When we got to our room it did not have a bath Not a complaint merely an observation We were happy either way","Room was small and double bed was of the smaller

larger than student hall room","Rooms were clean but seemed a little dated in comparison with reception and lower floor","The check in process took a long time","The room we were given after an upgrade was close to the lifts which did detract from the quietness expected","Check in staff unaware of accessibility request made on booking for walk in shower room with bath had been allocated causing delay at reception after long journey on train A suitable room was found for us so we were much relieved 1st floor needs better sound proofing as road noise spoils the experience","No parking Wafer thin walls it seemed Radiator wasn t getting warm Executive room Expected a bigger bed","No Negative","Although we upgraded to a better room this was located by the lift and vending machine The noise from people talking in the corridor went into the early hours","We didn t like the position of the bed it was a very small room which was fine we had all we needed however the bed was in a corner and one us had to be against the wall we tossed a coin and guess who lost","No Negative","The bathroom needed some reviewing e g bath tap top had come off and taps looked rather shabby The inconvenient placement of the toilet roll holder","Very little to complain about perhaps the room was a little too small","However another example of the LondonNewYorkTokyo effect That is where every

No washcloths","The safe wasn t working they didn t fix it","I booked a larger room and it was very small Goodness knows what the smaller rooms look like View was horrible over a dirty inner well area looking at other rooms across the way","The long que to check in and size of bedroom was a bit small","Although we paid more to have an executive room with air conditioning we were disappointed with the size of the double room The bathroom was very small and the positioning of the shower curtain around the bath made it very cramped After reading their description of these rooms we were expecting a bit more space The view was of three walls and windows which was not such a big deal but when a room is classed as executive your expectations are raised Adding bathrobes slippers etc to a very average room does not make it executive","Room was rather small No pool not even a sauna as I always like to relax for a while before and after going out","Room had no air conditioning stay was in early August and it was warm in the room Don t remember seeing that mentioned anywhere when I booked the room on your site","Despite having an executive room with breakfast included with a letter

due to the building work they re doing to the back of the hotel and I was woken up by the builders in the morning","The bed was too small for a double bed and one occupant was stuck against the wall with no reading light and no bedside table It seems that this was originally intended as a single room Also we saw people go directly from the street and upstairs and then leave again without entering a room This was a little unnerving","Very hot in the room No air con A fan was supplied but did not do the job","Basic room no lock on bathroom door Had to ask for some bathrobes to use","The bedrooms

room","Room was very warm and the air conditioning didn t make any difference We used a fan to cool which was in the room so they must be aware of the air con problem The bar staff were overrun at times and could of explained or apologised to customers who had become inpatient","Great location close to the Savoy Hotel and river Thames","We booked a cosy double and it certainly was cosy Not much

same in my case if iwould stay at atrand once again i may have breakfast only on day since now i know that there are few food options","I requested a street view but unfortunately we were stuck with a two by six window that faced on to scaffolding and we had to rely on electric lighting most of the time this let the experience down considerably two out of ten because of this cheers","The staff at reception could be a bit more welcoming a bit gruff on check in","We couldn t check in on arrival just before 3pm and waited with a free tea coffee until the room was ready as my Mum was tired after our journey Then the room was made up as a double not a twin as requested The beds were also quite hard","The shower was excellent a good size but the bathroom overall a little small Whilst everything was OK I think the hotel price is bordering on a little too high even for London as compared to other similar accommodation","The double bed was close up to the wall so made it only accessible from one side or the bottom You had to be quite agile","Only a few rooms were marked as executive rooms and appeared larger on the floor plan Our room was supposed to be executive but it seemed to be an ordinary room with a few extras squeezed in Not happy about this When queried at reception I did not get an explanation just a curt your room is executive","Quite a long queue for check in but staff very polite and helpful Scallfolding outside the window made the room very dark","Staff at the door dont even help to carry lift the luggages As they dont have a ramp you need to carry it on the

pillows were harder than we re used to or like Think that the plates should be warmed","there was no fridge in our room something we have come to expect in good hotels as the normal we were surprised we did not have one","The price of drinks in the bars was extortionate 14 00 for a gin and tonic and 5 60 for an insipid cappuccino all this does is make you look elsewhere when if the prices were realistic we would have used the bars more instead we drank in other places","The cosy room was a little smaller than anticipated although was perfectly adequate for a 2 night stay Main gripe was the building work going on adjacent to our window This made for a very noisy early morning","Very little natural light in the room with no view except scaffolding see photo attached Would have appreciated being told of this before I arrived","Single room quite small Bathroom facilities not the newest but clean and functioning fine","Possibly unavoidable darkness of the room could have been lightened by lighter brighter decor and furnishings","Main bar closes to residents at 11pm just when we were having a relaxing night cap after seeing a show Asked to move to the smaller Gin Palace bar","As above","The wifi didn t work for me not sure why Didn t really need it anyway","Lack of room climate control fridge and in our last stay an extremely small room Drinks v expensive but typical

Other than that which in the end didn t bother much our stay was very nice","The carvery in the hotel was adequate but nothing special especially not for the price Rooms are small and would feel cramped if you were staying for longer than 2 or 3 nights","Cold rooms but could turn up heat myself except from the bathroom A bit crowdy for breakfast with lines for waiting but when finally there the breakfast is nice","Some rooms were pretty loud as I heard a lot of complaints from other occupants in the hotel Our room faced the main road which is loud however once you shut the wooden blinds the noise virtually disappears Plus the wooden blinds allow for the room to become very dark which makes it easy to sleep in late","The room was a little small but it was in london so it was about what I could expect","There were no bed tables in the room and one of the beds was placed close to the wall The room in need of talc","Our room was 349 and we were wakened every morning very early due to noise of deliveries below one morning 4 30am to what sounded like empty bottles being put in to recycling lorry not impressed as were on a break and wanted a longer sleep in due to the noise this was not to be it would need to be another layer of glass on Windows to make it better sound proof our bathroom floor was also very tired like and needs a bit of attention","It is pricey but this is London Occasionally you can find a room for under 200 Pounds then its worth it Reception had to print my invoice out 8 times until they finally got it to use my current address and not the old one from 1 year ago","Only complaint we had was one morning in breakfast we was told to leave are table when we had only just finished our breakfast while still having drinks","Bedding was a bit worn out need to replace pillowcases","Short wait to get a seat at breakfast We would all like things to be cheaper but the early deals are good value","There was no view out of our window because they had a brick wall built in front of our window which sucked","As a frequent customer there is still a problem with accessing the lifts at peak periods they seem to bypass floors That s why I prefer to stay on lower floors","On Monday we did not have to leave the room until 12 midday but the builders started drilling at 9am it was so loud we had to leave such a shame","the walls between the rooms are very thin be ready to wake up when there is a wake up call in the room next door","My room very tiny was in the first floor and I could hear the noise of an engine constantly much more intense during the night a nightmare","BATHROOM IN MY ROOM WAS MADE FOR A TINY CIRCUS CLOWN WITH NO ARMS IT IS TOTALLY RIDICULOUS FUNCTIONALLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO HAVE IT SITED OUT IN THE HALLWAY OR THE SHOWER","Do not choose COSY room room ok toilet totally unacceptable shower no good can t use due to slanted roof and sitting on toilet roll holder when on toilet NOT GOOD","HOT food","The cooked breakfast was a real disappointment it was tired dried out and looked as if it had been sitting around for ages not what we would have expected for the price we paid","The room we were in wouldn t want to stay in again it was joined with original lyrics by the next door and now only separated by the adjoining door which was just sealed up but no soundproofing we could hear everything from that room to the conversations Was an awful room in that respect Having said that the hotel is great","Nothing","Service at breakfast was slightly slow no fridge in the bedroom had to discuss advertised discount on food and drinks at check out although it was granted in the end","Staff were clearly over stretched and a little rushed and impatient","No air conditioning on what was a very hot August weekend quite stuffy as a result The lifts took ages to come only one ever seemed to be in use at a time despite there being three of them","No air conditioning in standard rooms be warned if visiting in hot weather Room a little on the small side","The parsnips on the carvery were partially burnt My room did not have air conditioning although they did give me a fan When I book through your site I usually get an ordinary room This time I got a single which was rather small although the bathroom was very nice","The WiFi never worked in my room","small room with very noisy extractor fans from outside our room also the fans generated heat which made our room unbearable to sleep in","Breakfast was good but not great Like many London hotels very busy and they struggle at times to deal with the numbers at reception and in the restaurant","Not a major problem but there was a bit of a wait at reception when checking in and out Another member of staff to receive guests would have been welcome","Air conditioning in room We were there during a heat wave","Found the breakfast area rather crowded and cramped Food just average Charging 5 pounds per night to leave luggage is a joke also

get ready and this was agreed in advance and a payment of 20 was agreed for this but on arrival they had no rooms available for early check so this was cancelled","Mirrors are too far away to put

having to use one of the other dining rooms away form the main dining room food was warm but not hot","Reception queue was slow Reception staff untidy and we queued a 2nd time for nothing after being given wrong information regarding checking in our luggage early","I traveled with my 16yr old grandaughter We had booked a twin bed room and were given a double bed room Room was very small Also I thought asking 20 for an early check in was a bit much considering the full amount of our stay was taken from my account back in January So after traveling through the night and arriving in hotel at 9 00am we had to wait until 2 pm for our room Only 2 powerpoints in room one used for a table lamp Not great when trying to charge up multiple devices","Pricey the room could have been bigger for the price I paid No bidet in bathroom","One of the lifts was out of service for over 24h which resulted in long delays There is no air conditioning in the rooms which means that I won t be staying there in summer","No iron in room and room details stated there would be There was a leak over the window and the dripping water dropping onto the internal window sill woke me up and I had to put a towel under it This isn t new you can see from the state of the coving above the window","The breakfast was fine but the wait staff were erratic Did not always respond accurately to requests Check in staff were somewhat ornery","Walls are very thin loud talking late at night in next room kept us awake but was not bothered by street noise","Room was very small and too warm","Nothing","Two separate blankets would have been nice The room was tiny The check in process was painfully slow but I think it was because there was a trainee behind the desk The charge for an adapter 5 pounds was a rip off plus the concierge selling them was unfriendly","There was a long queue for check in however once we got to the desk the check in was very quick","It took a while to be served in the morning at breakfast","London and heating is not what we consider continental standard","Nothing A suggestion though Perhaps it might be time to think about a staff fund container visible to all guests to which one can contribute instead of giving tips to individuals who are present but those not present miss out","No Negative","The room is so small I am fairly petite and slight so it was ok but a taller bulkier person would have really struggled Ok for one night but impossible for longer","The decor and furnishings in the rooms could do with being up graded We did not eat breakfast there as at 18 95 we found it too expensive","My room was near the lifts and I could hear all the accompanying sounds the room s walls are pretty thin The full English breakfast was average nothing special The vending machine on my floor was out of order for the duration of my stay No fridge mini bar in the room","At 82 years of age more help with luggage would have been appreciated","View was a solid wall Breakfast was extremely busy and quite chaotic","Room was plain Wooden shutters meant that the view from the window was restricted which was a pity as we were on the 8th floor","It does feel like an industrial like hotel in terms of the number of tourists it caters to but this boils down to a question of the number of bedrooms","As a treat we tend to like to order breakfast up to the room but this isn t an option at this hotel which is a shame","Their were no twin rooms left at check in due to a large party we were offered a king upgrade but couldn t take the one bed offered to us due to age and comforts of individuals Waited til a room was found Otherwise all else was fine","Breakfast could have a greater choice room was on the first floor and it was very dark and small","The room was very different from those advertised Much smaller with a view of the back of some air on unit The bar prices were excessively high","There was really dirty grout in part of the bathroom which wasn

or me Signposting to my room at the quiet back of the 3rd floor was very very poor","we were in a room on the third floor overlooking the strand although the window was double glazed and there was was a wooden shutter there was still a lot of noise but not as bad as the room next door the walls must be paper thin the next room switched there tv on at 7 30 am we could here every word and it woke us up","We got told we had a free upgrade to Executive room nice but it was a standard double room no big deal","No Negative","The taps in the bathroom on the bath could do with being replaced The pillows also were a little hard","No Negative","No Negative","The bathroom was like a fridge extremely unpleasant after getting out of a warm bed in the middle of the night No hearing whatsoever didn t have time to complain as checking out there was a queue otherwise I would have aired my views","Their policy of charging 20 per room to enter it early if it happens to be ready when you check in early is disgraceful Also do not order a paper on a Sunday as they always deliver it without the magazines yet charge full price","Beds were rather hard Service at breakfast a bit haphazard other customers were directed to our table on both mornings so we had to move","Queue at check in but to be expected I suppose as it was 2 2 30pm There was also an enormous queue to be seated for breakfast which although looked horrendous when we first arrived went down really quick Paid a really high price this time we have stayed before at this hotel before a lot cheaper nothing going on in London so not clear why was so expensive","Hotel was clean but small points missed The underside of the bathroom tap was covered in toothpaste and the previous guests saliva toothpaste","I asked three people about getting breakfast in my room Three answers but it wasn t solved I was left waiting for someone to bring me a door card to the room Which they didn t I went to bed Woke up no time to go to the dining room for breakfast so asked for refund on breakfast fee and had to get breakfast on the move","The room was smaller than expected and it was odd to have a bed against the wall","could not get the shower to work in the morning but did not raise this with hotel staff on check out","We dont stay in London very often so our comparison is based on country stays and the odd stay in London we thought the room was very nice comfortable well decorated clean and tidy However the bathroom was looking tired and worn That said the shower was great but needed two towels to mop up leakage round the side of the curtain","Just a little bit more attention to cleaning the bathroom would have made this almost perfect","Weak tea for breakfast and waitress appeared astonished we asked for another tea bag but did get us one","Long queue for check in it was near Christmas and a few big groups booking in But still long wait","nothing really only that we had a executive room so told to have breakfast in the executive breakfast room Do think there was far more choice in the main breakfast room so would eat in there in future","I would have expected a little more to the room for the price Bathroom was clean but looked dated It had a feel of a premier in to the actual room compared to how luxurious the rest of the hotel looks","A really small point but the toilet roll holder was under the sink and not convenient for use had to remember to get some paper first Could not see a reason for this but found it just a little odd","Tiny bathroom Breakfast coffee was serve yourself but no one said where it was Very expensive probably due to the proximity to Xmas beleive it will be 50 cheaper in Jan","Man banged at my door 630 AM claiming to do a Bathroom Check Front desk said he was not with the hotel and had to send security up","Just a little point a plastic cup for the bathroom would been very useful","If you arrive early and would like to get access to your room before 15 00 you have to pay 20 Now if you stay more than one day and decide to wait until 15 00 you are already paying more for your room day 1 than the following days Not so nice","The hotel is very busy which means the lobby area is always crowded and noisy The single room I had was very small","There were always queues at reception The breakfast was too expensive compared to other hotels so we did not partake Although we upgraded our room it was still pretty cramped","Budget room fine for a one night stay but would not want to stay more than overnight Bar prices higher than expected for this hotel Absolutely no view","London prices are crazy Room very cold on arrivale as radiators turned off and window open It son warmed up once I turned on teh heating","Having to move rooms as the aircon which we paid extra for wasn t working The Strand is a busy place and an open window is not an option","No Negative","Tiny twin room not worth of money Breakfast was basic was disappointed there was no fresh vegetables or fish View from room terrible opposite to office building","Although the que to check in was long all desks were staffed and they went down quickly THe actual check in process was long winded for us We were a family of 6 occupying 3 rooms Each room needs individual check ins although they were all booked at the same time","Paid for a kingsize bed room but it was two singles put together Not pleased with that as not comfortable night sleep","I booked through Booking com and registered myself and two children When we got to the hotel they had only registered two people and the room we got did not fit an extra bed so all three of us had to sleep in the same bed the first night The remaining four nights we were able to upgrade the room to a larger room so they could fit in an extra bed and I had to pay for the upgrade It was probably booking com s search engine that was to blame I had prepaid the hotelbill but when I checked out the receptionist asked me to pay for the stay again I m glad I was awake enough to remind her that I had already payed or it would have been a really expencive stay I was very happy with the hotel exept for those details","Rooms are very small It would not qualify this hotel as a 4 anywhere else in Europe But the Brits as in many things proudly have their independent rating system","Our room was obviously a single room that had a double bed added so we so short of space the bed was against a wall meaning one of us had to climb over the other to get in and out also there was no room for a bed side table so our glasses alarm and phones had to go on the floor where they are easily damaged As a regular visitor to the Strand Palace we were disappointed","The room was very small I understand that it s Covent Garden so bigger rooms would mean higher prices For the space they had though it was well utilized","There wasn t anything we didn t like","The carvery dinner was not great The dinning room for breakfast was too large

although I requested to have the full English breakfast but with no mushrooms this would be forgotten","No Negative","Small room though perfectly comfortable","Room a little small and a bit stuffy","No air con in the room in July was tricky One lift out of action so getting luggage downstairs took ages","I have stayed here many times and will stay again on this occasion however the breakfast choice was not quite as good as previous stays No mushrooms no hash browns price supplement for eggs other than scrambled That said what was on offer was good","The lifts as others have mentioned were quite slow as one wasn t working Our room felt quite small even though only 2 of us were in there The bed was a bit hard and the bathroom was really small At one point the bathroom couldn t have been more than half a meter wide which meant we bumped ourselves constantly trying to get in or out of the shower There was also a huge amount of construction going on on our floor and outside the building It was extremely loud and would have been nice if we d been told to expect noise when we checked in","Please see comments above","I loved everything about the hotel except for the hot stuffy room at night Central air would have made a world of difference in the comfort level in sleeping at night The windows did not open enough to make any difference in the temperature level of the room","Poor choice of cereals for breakfast","No Negative","Really strong perfumed smell in the entrance and I think the walls are made of paper as you can here every conversation in rooms close by","Small lifts small room the view from the room all scaffoldings As for food non appetising calamari served in a small bowl at 7 30 scrambled eggs at breakfast looked raw","No Negative","As there wasn t any air conditioning we needed to leave windows open Therefore traffic noise was problematic","There was a very long delay checking in as the card machines were not working this caused a huge delay in checking in and carrying on with our business activities","Not a thing","Walls were a little thin so you could hear hairdryers TVs in other rooms","No Negative","We had an issue with the radiator in our room in the middle of the night but management dealt with it to our satisfaction","Cosy was a good description of the room very compact especially the bathroom perhaps a little too boxlike but clean and tidy Too much time spent waiting for lifts both up and down Only 2 operating of the 3 installed through the stay and with 8 floors and 50 rooms on each it was sometimes necessary to go through 3 passes to get a lift Hopefully the one locked off was temporary Bar snacks were small expensive and took a while to be delivered","The noise hardly got any sleep Which was a shame because we have stayed her 3 times before and not had a problem It was staff and deliveries chatting As I say if we had been on a higher floor we wouldn t have heard it We did ask to move but hotel was full","The bar area wasn t so tidy tables and bar needed a bit of a wipe","One of the three lifts were out of order which made waiting times for the lift quite lengthy and my bedroom shutters were broken","The rooms are not air conditioned so you re somewhat stuck with the unfashionable option of opening the window if you find the room too warm as we did when we arrived This also lets in the street noise The bathroom was perfectly functional but felt a little dated As is often the case with these larger places we found a large variation in the water temperature between morning and evening While it was not cold in the morning I couldn t get as hot a shower as my partner had managed the evening before Therefore I would suggest if a hot rather than comfortably warm shower is your preference wash before you go to bed rather than after you get up in the morning We were unfortunately disturbed by a housekeeper at around 9 30am We hadn t hung a do not disturb sign out as we had assumed that given it was our check out day and check out was at noon it was unlikely that the room would be attended early In big hotels this kind of thing sometimes happens but if you fancy a lie in it might be worth putting that sign out to ensure no one comes knocking","I really like hotel Some areas need refurbishment in corridors upstairs for example","We choose a Cosy room because we didn t need much space and were planning to spend our time out and about We had seen the pictures and did appreciate that the bed was against the wall We didn t think this would be a problem but didn t appreciate that for the person next to the wall it would be difficult to get in or out of bed without disrupting the other My impression was that it was a single room with a double bed put in it Overall perhaps a little too small but that is our mistake we had seen the pictures D cor is showing signs of age throughout Largely well maintained it is showing its age as looking dated rather than poorly maintained or poor quality Gin Palace prices are a bit high at c 15 for a G T","No Negative","The double bed was against the wall so the person on that side me had to slide to the end of the bed to get out not so convenient especially in the middle of the night Also no side table because of the position so nowhere to put water book etc","evening meal in the carvery was not up to much Food was cold didn t eat much and therefore worked out expensive Would not eat here again","Let us know about the Comedy Club at the time of the booking so we could have got tickets as they were sold out by the time we discovered it","Not much shelf space in the bathroom If hotels are serious about wanting guests to re use towels then there needs to be enough decent towel rail space to hang them on","Even though the breakfast was good and plentiful with lots of choice the coffee was awful","Booked a twin got a small double bed up against the wall no bedside table window did not open noisy neighbours unti 1 30 am","The shower control was v stiff and took a lot of turning","Check out is 12pm as stated however from 8am onwards every hour the room cleaners kept knocking the door to check if we was leaving or if we had left Making us feel we had to rush to leave which didn t end our weekend in the best way","I thought the bathroom in the room was In need of upgrading","Bed was not a double bed but a 3 4 bed also disappointed that if I had of booked directly with the hotel I could have saved 35 and also would have got a 15 voucher to spend at the bar","We booked the 2 course carvery and whilst the carvery itself was satisfactory the dessert choice was poor and the fruit salad we chose was to say the least unadventurous I guess for the price in London it was an acceptable meal but sadly didn t live up to the level of the rest of the hotel","The room was small","Bed was a little hard but that is down to personal preference","Room looked a little tired It was quite noisy from taps and toilet flushing in the early hours Last time we stayed here it was very quiet at night Maybe we were just unlucky this time","Noisy room traffic very loud also could hear next room talking and tv loud","We were in the executive dining room for breakfast which was a little dowdy The breakfast was satisfactory but could have been better The other dining room looked much brighter I asked at approx 8am in the morning for some milk to enable us to have a cup of tea in the room and reception said they would get house keeping to send it Nothing came by the time we left at about 11am","I did not like the look of the eggs or the bacon so didn t eat these I wish you had the little individual pots of Marmite","I was happy with everything there was nothing in particular that would warrant a negative comment at this point","On this occasion as it was NYE and I was staying with a friend who had a separate room at the Strand I stayed in a single room for 170 which is over priced when it s usually 120 for a double Never the less I couldn t fault the hotel at all","Room had no drawers for clothes and was quiet small and because we didn t book direct we didn t receive a 15 voucher and a bottle of prosecco which we had when we stayed before","Not enough staff clearing breakfast tables and ditribution tea coffee bit haphazard as a result","Breakfast Pork excludes Jews and Muslims among others from eating suasages etc Maybe alernate with beef turkey for example Coffee was very good though","Staff weren t too friendly when we checked in Inconsistent customer service The breakfast was disappointing","Very Expensive drinks large ish glass of wine 9 very nice G T 13 Breakfast was too expensive so we went elsewhere","The way the price fluctuates on website bookings I paid 140 without breakfast it later went to just under a 100 with breakfast I know it s the website s fault but it makes it difficult to know when to book","Long wait for tables for breakfast perhaps sharing a list of peak hours would help","My mattress was not very comfortable not terrible but could have been better","Nothing","Waiting for lifts but it s a big hotel with lots of guests so that s to be expected","Mixup on checking out with Reception asking me for payment for breakfast added on to my bill when computer showed I had already paid for an added in breakfast This meant that someone had given my room number at breakfast when I was staying alone","Better bedroom lighting would be good Not keen on the wooden shutters that they do not open fully","slept on double bed one side against wall no room to walk over to the side there were enough tea and coffee but only 4 jiggers of milk so had to phone housekeeping to let us have some more mirror on the desk was fixed so had to use one in bathroom but no light above the mirror asked for decaf at breakfast and found tea on table when came back and i never drink tea with breakfast","Room was not ready until 4 pm on arrival day Also room cleaning was very late only in the end of the afternoon","No air conditioning in the bedrooms Not normally a problem but we were there in sweltering temperatures and the fan provided did not provide adequate relief at night","The bed could have been more comfy","No Negative","Wheelchair accessability could be improved There s a ramp to the side of the hotel but the doors into the hotel are very heavy and awkward to try open when on your own with the wheelchair","Lack of air conditioning In a 4 star hotel it should be a given If premier Inn can have it why can t you In this day and age it s a must","It was a hot weekend so air conditioning would have been good although there was a fan in the room which was a bonus and helped","paying for ice come on what is that all about just add 1 to every room and make it free Had to troop down to the concierge get him to make change troop back up to 6th floor etc","No Negative","Queueing for breakfast Staff in breakfast room a little lacking manners when you are carrying your food to table Although food good bacon very overcooked","I had unfortunately used Booking com and made a slight error When I called the hotel one member of staff said I would definitely need to contact Booking com again I tried but could not get a response from them so I called the hotel again and another member of staff told me she could make the amendment after all I was grateful that the second member of staff knew what she was doing Next time I shall book directly with the hotel as they give you incentives when you book through them","No Negative","Not being able to open windows very hot in bedroom bathroom","First room was noisy but then I was moved to another one which was perfect","Bathroom very compact shower over bath awkward and not that easy to control water direction Toilet in bathroom needed fixing during our stay poor flush Room very hot","Room wasn t ready when we turned up to check in and they didn t seem to have a clue why and we waited for an hour to get the room key","room was expensive but as we paid for location it was to be expected I suppose","Restaurant for breakfast was quite small given the size of the hotel however food was good","The room was too hot couldn t open the windows wide enough to get some fresh air in so neither of us got much sleep The view was bad into some scruffy courtyard with other windows but that didn t bother us that much I guess we got what we paid for","Lighting in bathroom could be better","No air con meant the room would most likely be hot during high Summer","Front desk said local calls were free but then got charged 20p for two calls No big deal but misleading","Choice of room far too small We did not understand how small a cosy room would be Next time we will be more careful Noisy fan somewhere near our room","The food too much was produced at the same time which meant that the roast potatoes were cool and hard and the vegetables only warm Breakfast was the same lots of food going cool and hard","Breakfast service was just satisfactory Tables need to be cleared whilst you are still sitting there and getting more to eat as the tables are small and have no extra room for finished dishes","Fire alarm went off at 6am these things happen and there was very little communication about what was going on where to go etc Breakfast was fine but unspectacular and the staff were brusque one was quite pushy when I said I was on my own and wanted my own table rather than being seated with the stranger in front of me","Walls are too thin everything could be heard from next door Traffic noise was bad but is only to be expected due to the convenient position","Bed not facing the right way to watch television with television on the wall could not get comfortable","Breakfast rather overcooked Not enough lifts for large building Walls very thin so you hear everything in next room","Breakfast could have been a little better and also wasn t very hot","Could hear people s voices from the neighbouring room","queue for breakfast have stayed here several times before and never experienced a problem when the dining room extended to the left management will know what i mean by this","My room was advertised as cosy and it certainly was As I was on my own it was fine but a couple may find it less comfortable as there isn t much room for two bags and one side of the bed is against the wall So if you want a bit more space don t book the cosy room","Asked to borrow iphone 6 charger they said didn t have one don t believe no one has ever left one behind also asked for Earl Grey tea bags in the room from housekeeping but said they didn t have any at breakfast guess what they had Earl Grey teabags how hard would it of been to bring a couple up to the room","A mini fridge would be ideal","The room was very comfortable and clean but a little on the small side Bed was up against a wall on one side which meant climbing over the other person sharing the bed","Hot food on breakfast buffet a little dry","Rooms old fashioned but I don t think anything can be done about that It s not a big issue","No Negative","Hotel has a wonderful carvery grill however they do not offer a single course option in the evening which we would have liked prior to our theatre visit","We were situated on the street side of the hotel and despite the lovely shutter blinds the noise from the traffic was quite evident during the night particularly Perhaps need to have more glazing to soundproof the windows",null,"Heating noisy when

From 9 am there was huge line in the breakfast Room bit small even the bigger one","mattress on the bed was gone sagged in the middle so very uncomfortable and a poor night s sleep as a result","No Negative","Bed was too firm rooms are small","Insulation not good Could hear guests in next room occasionally Bed was not very comfortable","I was not impressed with the concierge services After being sold tour tickets and advised that it was cheaper to buy at the hotel I learned otherwise Additionally I was never advised to purchase audio tours and found that I had to do this independently each and every time I was not given steady advice for using the tube or bus system and often found that my own research faired better than what was offered The concierge also did not seem as informed about the restaurants in the area","The bed was a bit creaky and the walls were quite thin consequently the room was a bit noisy","We had a slight problem we asked for clean towels as we had used the ones

vegetarian","Decor a little dated No view from window","It would be good to have aircon rather than just a fan The beds could be a bit larger too","We found the bacon at breakfast to be dry and the scrambled egg a little on the sloppy side Unfortunatly the fried eggs had a snotty substance on top which was a little off putting Maybe breakfast would taste better if prepared fresh rather than as a buffet For the price we payed it was disappointing","As in many hotels breakfasting alone was a gamble go to get toast and your table s been reallocated before you return","The fact that there was no air con in the room thankfully the weather was very hot for our stay but we enjoyed","Breakfast was pretty chaotic waiting to be seated long Q s for food The rooms are not airconditioned were very hot","No Negative","Lack of air conditioning in bedrooms It was during an extremely hot spell There was a fan in the room but it was extremely noisy A swimming pool would have been a bonus far too hot

quite small","Queuing up for breakfast or being guided to a makeshift breakfast space is no fun","A bit noisy with window open but fine with earplugs","Could have done with a fridge in the room but

t arrive and I was charged for it but this was resolved at check out","Although the bathroom was clean it was fairly dated for a 4 star hotel The bath enamel had a black chip which didn t look great The basin and shower tap were quite old so had lost it shine and you could see the soap residue on them The TV in the room cold be a bit bigger as my daughter is blind in one eye and bad vision in the other so she couldn t see the screen from sitting on the bed and a long day","We stayed in a small double it was small The bed very small there was no radiator in the bathroom therefore it was very cold when getting out of the shower","Breakfast was crowded probably due to size of hotel","The room was very hot The windows only open slightly not letting in a lot of breeze The bed was not very comfy at all and really hurt my back made my back problem a lot worse","The breakfast that was delivered didn t match the breakfast in the menu and was general very poor value for money and below the standards I would expect The 15 bar credit that I was entitled to for booking through your website was never given or even offered to me","Check in took a long time it would be nice if it was quicker

basic room was pretty small with the bed right against the wall Not much more to say as generally good for the money","The price of drinks in the bar I know people expect to pay a bit more in a hotel

this","Pillows too firm for me Room very small","Shower over bath flooded the bathroom floor despite our best efforts The room was very cosy OK for us as we were out and about a lot","Paying for early check in seems a bit over the top if one s room which has been pre paid is available why should have to pay another 20 to get access to it","With two women sharing the bedroom the complimentary shampoo body wash etc needed doubling Better organization for breakfast in the dining room felt like being in school when taken in crocodile fashion around to 2nd dining room","Too long to book in The hotel needs to think about actively offering people with access issues a quicker means of booking in I told staff I couldn t stand for long periods because of a long term knee problem however I was

police sirens and noisy traffics No aircon in my room just fan","Bar could serve a better range of bottled beer husbands comment","The breakfast choice was excellent however the pre made yellow bread crumbed hash browns were on offer as usual elsewhere sometimes baked fairly hard We stay in plenty of hotels in UK and abroad and on cruise ships and the modern way for offering potatoes nowadays seems to be saut ed sometimes with mushrooms or onions mixed in delicious We realise that some people do actually like the pre formed hash browns but perhaps the Strand Palace could provide both to appeal to all their customers Not a complaint but a helpful suggestion","Price discrepancy between Booking com and actual hotel Booked on site on arrival to London through website for 318 USD for 2 nights and ended with charges of 315 difference of 90 No early check in room size a little small","Very hot room No window to open Fan was provided which did help but could not sleep well as I did not think it advisable to leave fan on all night Hot drinks from bar rather over priced","One member staff while waiting for my airport transport after my check out offered to bring my luggage to the side doors to wait for my transport when I realized that he had put me standing outside for my 30 to 40 minutes waiting time for my shuttle to arrived but previously he had done the same to other customers as to clear the main entrance hall where to say there is seating for waiting But everything else was great service and professional Thank to all Staff Members","One of the lifts was out of order during the whole weekend","As a twin room the area around the beds was a little snug Perfectly fine for overnight but would have been irritating on a longer stay","Only negative is that there was no dresser or drawer storage in our room Our rate was good so not really complaining about that too much","Only negative was that the tea served at breakfast awful and provided in your room not very nice","2 defects for maintenance ROOM 519 the left hand bed headboard light had a trapped wire hanging below the fitting and the connection to the shower electric towel rail had been taped up health and safety issues The only other point was when approaching our room on saturday afternoon we witnessed the housekeeping supervisor virtually shouting at a member of staff saying she was not doing her job properly and implying she could be dismissed When we said we wanted to go into our room the supervisor told us abruptly to return in 15 minutes surely this matter should have been dealpt with behind closed doors not in front of guests I found our room on both friday and saturday excellent with beds correctly made one of the issues being shouted to the housekeeper by the supervisor Other than this i found everything excellent and will definately stay here again next time we return to London","No Negative","Room still slightly small but didn t really matter for one night stay","Nothing","Rather noisy as near the lift and sound insulation from corridor wasn t very efficient The view from the window was rather grim with a frosted lower half and wooden shutters for privacy but to be fair we did ask for a quiet room away from The Strand","Could do with more normal tea bags in room and a couple more milks Coffee drinkers are spoilt for choice","My daughters were in an outside room which was very noisy The check in process is shocking when we arrived the queue was enormous which is awful for tourists and UK residents alike When I requested more staff I was talked to quite rudely being told I could have checked in online if I had booked with the hotel direct which would have cost more Funnily enough once I had returned to the queue miraculously some more staff arrived","Nothing serious here but I was there for four nights and breakfast are exactly the same every day","I could have had a cheaper deal if I had booked direct","Maybe more tv channels Or

anyway","They didn t like coming home","No Negative","Noise from pipes was very loud Plumbing needs looking at","My room was located in the first floor just above one of the restaurants in the hotel and the smell of meat cooking was really quite strong I didn t mind to much but if you want to avoid that I suggest a room higher up","Our room was a cosy double small would be a better description The cooked breakfast could have done being a bit hotter","Nothing The whole event was great","The only two negatives I have for the hotel is that there was a lack of storage space for clothing and this was for a 5 day trip It s definitely not suitable for a long stay as there is nowhere to put more than a few days worth of clothes Secondly this gripe wasn t with the hotel but the room service We ordered two desserts and a cheese board on our last night usual rooms service prices overpriced The ice cream while not made in the hotel was fine The cheesecake was acceptable but not the quality you d expect and also came with strawberries not the stated raspberries small thing but we re allergic to strawberries but the issue really was with the cheeseboard It came with none of the accompaniments It was supposed to come with chutney quince jelly and cracker It was only the cheese that was delivered We called twice and asked for the missing items but they were never delivered to our room","Headroom in shower a bit tight but not a real problem paid about 60 more than I did earlier in the year for the same room short stay","Nothing but price","Noise from neighbouring bedrooms and corridors was somewhat excessive early and late","Breakfast let it down spent too long under the lamps to keep it warm made some items overcooked eggs could have done with being cooked slightly more little runny on the top","The luxury afternoon tea was overpriced the food was mediocre and the service was not good","Signage for the rooms could be clearer So many rooms a bit of a rabbit warren","Nothing really breakfast was a bit rushed like we were asked have you finished because we want to clear away this was at 9 15 as it happened we had finished but just felt a big rushed nothing is complain about though to be honest","No Negative","its not their fault as they cannot change the views however i could see this being a problem for some people Also not all rooms have aircon","I would have preferred to have had a room with a view of the outside It was a little sad to think I paid for an executive room and the view was just an internal one","No Negative","All good apart from the kettle in the room had tea leaves in it and hadn t been cleaned The Dawaat restaurant in the hotel served very tiny portions","Nothing","It might have been better for my nerves not to have had the fire alarm sounding at 9 00 in the evening for a false alarm but better safe than sorry","Wasn t impressed with the breakfast over priced and bacon hard and chewy croissants hard and taste horrible this is the only thing that let the hotel dwn everything else was great","I would have loved a small fridge in the room","No Negative","No Negative","Lower price of the breakfast would have made this perfect or possibly some discount to breakfast places nearby","Room was very hot and only a quilt on the bed Would have been nice to have the option of a sheet instead Other than that the hotel was perfect for what we wanted and was great value for money","Bit on the expensive side for just one but I m worth it","The queue to get into breakfast","Can not understand why when I booked over the internet that I was quoted 20 per head for breakfast which I was willing to pay 80 for four breakfasts on my visa card and when I got to the hotel and said I would like to pay hotel and breakfast in cash instead of my Visa card Breakfast dropped straight away to 10 per head Also I booked an early arrival booking lunch time nothing was mentioned about the extra 20 fee I had to pay until I arrived at the hotel I think you should give better details to those hotel sites internet you have your details on I will stay again at your hotel but will certainly not include breakfast until I arrive and pay cash for them at 10 per head cheaper Mx","No Negative","I d have liked a fridge to store fresh milk in","Breakfast to be seated in the dark Indian restaurant and tables being set for lunch around us while we were still eating our breakfast","No Negative","Nothing in particular","Cosy rooms really are cosy One side against wall web photo misleading","Used the restaurant for a carvery meal one evening which whilst adequate could have been better However the breakfast was excellent great choice and presentation","No Negative","cant think of anyrthing","My only negative feedback is that we booked an Executive King room with Air Conditioning The Air Con wasn t very good And the fact that they charge extra for rooms with it you would expect it to be in better working order","Nothing really The hotel is a bit dated but then it is London and I like the feeling of an established hotel","The size of the room It was like being in a cupboard","No Negative","Matress was a bit uncomfotable and the view was of a building directly opposite Check in took a while due to lack of staff on the counter","The scrambled eggs for breakfast were a little soggy and tasteless","The 6am fire alarm lol but your staff where A1 informed about situation and strangely a comfort to know our safety was cared for Reguarding fire alarm going off exit out of the building was clearly marked making it an easy quick exit","The ensuite taps bath sink were not in great condition may need to be replaced to improve the look of the place","Breakfast queue and service charge they wanted for ice in our room after giving a Birthday complimentary bottle of bubbly","Requested a bathtub as I have sore hips Was informed I would have to upgrade and pay extra for this Disappointing as the receptionist could see I has 2 walking sticks and difficulty walking and explained showering is difficult for me","The only thing I just wish I would have upgraded the room It was really nice just a tad on the small size","Toilet roll holders very low to floor and low ceiling in shower","Checking in procedure Our room was accidently allocated elsewhere This was resolved but took time The Hotel was very busy though","Nothing really","We used the restaurant before our night out and was going to use the deal card from our room door to have the carvery I can t have alcohol and asked if I was able to have a soft drink with it instead of the Ale or wine and was told no I do feel that that should be changed not everyone can have or want alcohol so also it would of been nice to have a bath mat when stepping out of the shower bath as it could be slippery and you don t really want to put your towel on the floor","Lobby was a bit outdated I didn t spend much time there so overall the hotel was great","Rooms could have been larger We booked a cosy double and were upgraded but the room was still tiny though spotlessly clean","The breakfast room was packed after 7 30 a m Nevertheless they did seem to have a system to deal with the crowd","The only faults I could find with the hotel are the windows being locked in the rooms which made it difficult to get fresh air And the bath tubs were too small I m only 5 ft 4 and I couldn t fit Which was a shame as I wanted to relax from the long journey and before going out for the night Just to note my boyfriend and I were woken up the morning by a cleaner coming in the room without knocking She soon realised we were still in there and left so make sure you leave a don t disturb sign on your door","No Negative","I was advised that I would have an upgrade but I couldn t discern the difference","Drinks in the bar a little expensive 13 95 for a cocktail Seems when the old Mask Bar got a facelift to the Gin Palace so did the prices","Honestly there is nothing I didn t like","when we check in they give us a room in first floor which facing window towards inner walls but they have changed as we request to change","No Negative","When I entered the room it was cold A strong cold draft through the windows although closed To have to shut the wooden shutters and not see out at all was a bit of a drag","Eating facilities were good as was the choice but the meals as expected are pricey","Housekeeping woke us up early on the morning of departure Could do with a little extra sound proofing between bedrooms","Bathroom very cold only small heated towel rail Draft from windows","a ramp at the front to assist with getting suit cases up and down the stairs would have been easier","We had a fire alarm and had to gather in the foyer at 3 50 am after climbing down 7 flights of stairs It was a false alarm but as there were quite a lot of worried guests it would have been considerate if the young man on reception had kept us informed Had to hear via word of mouth to return to bed","Long queues to check in Room on the smaller side Breakfast expensive cheaper places close by Price is high but comparative to London prices","No Negative","9 50 for a Bailey s seems a little pricey","I asked at breakfast if I could have a gluten free breakfast but they could only give me gluten free bread and could not tell me if the beans hash browns or sausages were GF so had to leave these off my plate More education in gluten free foods is needed","Nothing","The view out of our window looked onto nothing but other rooms Windows but didn t book the hotel for a view TV faced bed not sofa","Not overly happy that the cleaner came into the room whilst I was in the shower and my wife was drying her hair on the morning of our departure Next time leave the Do Not Disturb sign on the door Obviously keen to get started on her day","No Negative","In the foyer while enjoying drinks the maid came round and polished the tables we were using Not a bad thing as the place is spotless but not very pleasant with the spray when you are relaxing and catching up with friends Everything else was excellent this was a minor point in a great weekend","took a while to answer phones at reception but i expect they were very busy more staff needed maybe","Can not find any fault with the hotel or staff always perfect","Concierge gave me no option but to buy a two day hop on hop off bus pass That one day passes were available was not explained to me","No Negative","No Negative","No Negative","The main door

in night having first moved the bed away from wall More like big single rather than double You need to be tidy to know where you put things","The room was quite cold","Having stayed at hotel several times previously on a B B basis when in London on business I have always enjoyed the breakfast However when booking independently I thought the price excessive bearing in mind I got a full English breakfast at Garfunkel s next door for 5 99 less thana third than the hotel were charging","No Negative","No Negative","The single bed","The general breakfast hall was packed out I had an upgrade to the executive breakfast hall which sounds grand but it was just quite ordinary but quiet Lovely","Nothing bad to say about this stay","TV wasn t very big and accessing regular TV programs and or films

telephoned to change the booking I was told that our stay would cost an extra 130 but that this would now include breakfast which we hadn t originally asked for As I currently have to take a Fat Free Diet until I can have an operation this seemed ideal as I would be able to choose from the menu the things I could eat However when we booked in we were informed that this was not correct and

than 10 persons in the restaurant We did get another table when we insisted but we should have had to have the discussion","The toilet paper was only 2 ply people fold it over and use 4 times the

<p>The sample size of 4120 reviews is a challenge to tidy for further analysis. Here we use the tidytext steps to extract the insights.</p>
<ul>
<li>step 1: cut the text into single words</li>
<li>step 2: remove stopwords</li>
<li>step 3: apply sentiment lexicon (in this case bing lexicon)</li>
<li>step 4: apply pairwise correlation calculations to get high correlated words</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two steps show the filtered selection of words arranged by frequency.</p>

<p>In this case, the word <strong>negative</strong>, <strong>small</strong> or <strong>breakfast</strong> appears on the top. Since the analyzed reviews are negative the word “negative” doesn’t have any significance and will be removed from the analysis.</p>
<p>Let’s visualize the words using a basic chart.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/word%20sentiment%20analysis-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The chart displays the most frequent words by sentiment. It seems the words <strong>noisy</strong>, <strong>expensive</strong>, <strong>cold</strong> are used often when describing the hotel stay. This is important for the property operators since it is direct feedback from customers. Feedback can lead to precise refurbishment project aimed to remove the most critical issues.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s look at the collection of words that appear in the reviews next to other words, which are highly correlated.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2019-01-22-what-can-hotel-landlords-learn-from-the-guest-reviews-use-case-from-booking-com-dataset_files/figure-html/nove-1.png" width="864" /></p>
<p>The chart reveals frequent issues that hotel guest are frequently commenting. The first group of issues revolves around words like <strong>door</strong>, <strong>walls</strong>, <strong>thin</strong> or <strong>hear</strong>. This set of words points out the fact that the walls between the rooms are thin and the noises from the neighbor is disturbing for the guest. Next group of words is connected to the word <strong>air</strong> or <strong>window</strong>. It appears <strong>air conditioning</strong> and <strong>view outside</strong> is an issue.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this article, I have analyzed approx. 500.000 hotel reviews written by hotel guests. Using tidytext principles and distribution analysis we have found that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business guest are harder to satisfy (in general, across the cities)</li>
<li>Paris and Vienna business guest reviews are the highest</li>
<li>Nationality of the reviewer plays an important role (overall rating, hotel choices)</li>
<li>Hotel Strand analysis shows: overall rating drops in summer 2017. Air condition, thin walls, view outside, long check-in and double booked rooms are often mentioned</li>
</ul>
